Lesions of testis and epididymis associated with prenatal diethylstilbestrol exposure.

Abstract
Cryptorchidism and retention of Müllerian duct structures occur with high frequency among the male offspring of CD-1 mice treated with 100 micrograms diethylstilbestrol/kg body weight on days 9 through 16 of pregnancy. Hyperplasia of the rete testis and Müllerian duct structures were found in many of the DES-treated male mice, as was a low but significant number of reproductive tract neoplasms.
