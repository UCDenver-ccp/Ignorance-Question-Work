The book covers a variety of topics in a lucid manner under four distinct sections namely 'Nutrition for Health', 'Nutrition for Special Circumstances', 'Nutrition for Disease States', and 'Food Policy'. The first section comprises 10 chapters on various aspects of nutrition such as nutrition adequacy to dietary supplements. The second section covers the role of nutrition in pregnancy and lactation, exocrine and sports as also food allergy. The third section has 14 chapters and covers various diseases from cardiovascular diseases to HIV/AIDS, osteoporosis, liver diseases and neurological disorders. Further, the various chapters in the book explain the basic principles in nutrition coupled with applications in different clinical conditions.
The chapters on nutrition in pregnancy, exercise, food allergies and intolerance, etc are informative and will be a good read for students in the respective field.
It is noteworthy that the book covers several aspects of food policies as well including food sustainability, food labelling, food industry and consumer nutrition. It would have been worthwhile to include some more topics such as management of severely acute malnutrition, examples of high, low and moderate glycaemic index foods, how to read food labels (with examples), etc and also additional references for further reading would have been beneficial as the chapters are a quick guide to appraise the topic.
Overall, this book will be of benefit to postgraduates in the field of nutrition, nutritionists in hospitals and physicians.
