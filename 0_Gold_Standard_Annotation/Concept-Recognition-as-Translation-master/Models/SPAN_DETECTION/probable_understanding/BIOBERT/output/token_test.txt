This

,
the
decreased

been
linked
to
inflammatory
processes
associated
with

insulin

As
in
our
studies
,
these
inconsistent
findings
point
to
the
existence
of
complicated
pathways
for
the
function
of
vitamin
D
in
disease
processes
,
or
simply
that
the
correct
[SEP]
[CLS]
effective
dose
of
vitamin

supplement
##ation
needs
to
be
better
defined
.
[SEP]
[CLS]
However
,
no
statistical

was
indicated

were

the

Thus
,
the
association

is
not
clear
and
warrant
##s
further
