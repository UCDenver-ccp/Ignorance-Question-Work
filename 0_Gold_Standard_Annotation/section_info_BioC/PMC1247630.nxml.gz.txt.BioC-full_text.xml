Recent research has confirmed that ALL can originate in utero. New findings from the NIEHS-funded Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study (NCCLS) show that the disease may originate even earlierâin the foods a woman eats before she even becomes pregnant.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>766</offset><text>The effect of maternal diet on child leukemia risk has not been rigorously studied; the few studies that have been done have focused on specific dietary factors, and the results have been mixed. The NCCLS is a population-based caseâcontrol study of risk factors for child leukemia, including maternal diet. It is the first study to capture mothersâ overall dietary patterns and relate them to child leukemia.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1179</offset><text>Researchers compared 138 mothers of children diagnosed with ALL with a control group of 138 mothers whose children did not have cancer. All the mothers completed a questionnaire pertaining to their diet in the 12 months prior to pregnancy. The researchers chose this period as a more accurate reflection of each womanâs typical diet, compared to pregnancy, when diet can vary with the degree of nausea experienced. The questionnaire asked about 76 food items, plus use of vitamins, certain reduced-fat foods, and cooking fat.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1707</offset><text>The researchers found that the more vegetables, fruits, and proteins a woman ate, the lower the risk of her child having leukemia. Of the vegetables and fruits, carrots and cantaloupe showed the highest inverse effect, perhaps because of these foodsâ high carotenoid content. String beans and peas also correlated inversely with ALL risk. Among the proteins, beef and beansâboth sources of the antioxidant glutathioneâshowed the highest inverse effect. Use of vitamin supplements was not significantly linked to leukemia risk.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2240</offset><text>The authors stress that dietary factors work together, and no one food should be singled out in attributing risk or benefit. Further, a cause-and-effect relationship can not be concluded from this study. However, they write, it remains prudent for women who are pregnant or think they may become pregnant to eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables.</text></passage></document></collection>
