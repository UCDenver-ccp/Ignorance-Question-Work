The molecular mechanisms that underlie these observations remain unclear, although recent work suggests that alterations to placental function may lead to altered fetal development and programming, likely playing a critical role in mediating these associations. Throughout in utero development, the placenta, through the production of various enzymes and hormones, plays an important role in controlling growth and development through the transfer of nutrients and waste and in protecting the fetus from many xenobiotic insults. Recent work has demonstrated that placental genetic and epigenetic profiles may possibly serve as markers of the intrauterine and extrauterine environment.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3073</offset><text>DNA methylation is a key mode of epigenetic regulation, which can lead to silencing of genomic regions. DNA methylation patterns are essential for the growth and maintenance of tissue-specific expression profiles in different cell types during development, and these patterns become set during in utero development.

These DNA repetitive elements are made up of interspersed and tandem repeats and comprise at least half of the human genome. Specifically, interspersed repeats are composed of retrotransposable elements such as long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs). The LINE-1 subclass is the most common LINE, representing about 20% of the total human genome, whereas the most abundant type of SINE is the Alu element, as exemplified by AluYb8; together LINE and Alu sequences make up nearly one-third of the genome. The methylation status of these elements may represent a passive dosimeter by being altered by various exposures, although differences in the underlying structure of these elements and the unclear function of methylation of these regions suggest that their alteration and their potential relevance need to be more carefully examined.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4717</offset><text>Thus, in this study we examined how the intrauterine environment is related to the methylation status of LINE-1 and Alu regions (specifically LINE-1 and AluYb8, respectively) in a functionally relevant fetal tissue, the placenta.

This hospital performs approximately 85% of all obstetrical deliveries in Providence County (the largest population center in Rhode Island) and approximately 74% of all deliveries in Rhode Island. Study eligibility criteria for mothers included healthy mothers ranging from 18 to 40 years of age, with no history of gestational diabetes, psychological disorders, or genetic disorders. Eligibility criteria for infants included viable infants of term births (born &gt; 37 weeks of gestation) with no known genetic disorders or life-threatening illnesses. We selected infants considered small for gestational age (SGA; &lt; 10th percentile of birth weight) and matched non-SGA infants to these for infant sex, maternal age (Â± 3 years), and gestational age (Â± 2 days). For a description of placental tissue use, DNA extraction, and DNA purification procedures, see Supplemental Material, Supplementary Text 1 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1103927).

Birth weight percentile was calculated using the Fenton growth chart from gestational age and birth weight in grams, allowing us to account for gestational age in our birth weight metric and to create a normalized distribution for birth weight through birth weight percentile. Birth weight percentile was stratified into three clinically meaningful categories to create birth weight status: SGA babies, defined as babies whose birth weight lies below the 10th percentile for that gestational age; appropriate for gestational age (AGA) babies, defined as babies whose birth weight lies above the 10th percentile for that gestational age and below the 90th percentile for that gestational age; and large for gestational age (LGA) babies, defined as babies whose birth weight lies above the 90th percentile for that gestational age.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7491</offset><text>DNA methylation analysis. Repetitive element DNA methylation was determined by bisulfite pyrosequencing of the LINE-1 and the AluYb8 repetitive elements as previously described.

The data were then assembled using BeadStudio methylation software (version 1.9.0; Illumina), without normalization, per the manufacturerâs instructions. We used array control probes to assess the quality of our samples and evaluate potential problems such as poor bisulfite conversion or color-specific issues for each array. Mahalanobis distance was used to screen outliers, and all CpG loci on X and Y chromosomes were excluded from the analysis, to avoid sex-specific methylation bias, leaving a final 26,486 autosomal CpG loci representing 13,890 unique genes. We and others have previously demonstrated that methylation of CpG loci detected through BeadArray platforms can be reliably replicated using alternative detection techniques including pyrosequencing, MassARRAY analysis, and quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9596</offset><text>Statistical methods. Univariate associations of exposures and demographics with birth weight percentile status or with LINE-1 and AluYb8 extent were examined using KruskalâWallis tests for continuous covariates and chi-square tests for categorical covariates. A Pearson correlation was used to examine the correlation between LINE-1 and AluYb8 extents. Multiple linear regression was then used to evaluate the association between LINE-1 or AluYb8 methylation levels and continuous birth weight percentile. All models were adjusted for infant sex and maternal age, body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy, ethnicity (non-Caucasian/Caucasian), and alcohol, tobacco, and prenatal vitamin use during pregnancy (all yes/no).

Using a data-driven recursively partitioned mixture model (RPMM), these CpG loci were clustered into 16 methylation classes based on like methylation pattern obtained from the array results, pruning the model after four splits to maintain power. For each subject, 16 corresponding aggregate methylation values were obtained by averaging together average methylation Î²-values from all CpGs within each class. RPMM classes were labeled using a series of numbers, ranging from 1 to 16 (with class 1 having the lowest methylation level and class 16 having the highest methylation level). RPMM was selected for this analysis because we have demonstrated that RPMM provides more consistent clustering and more robustness in the selection of the number of classes because of its hierarchical presentation of classes, compared with metric hierarchical clustering, for this data set [see Supplemental Material, Supplementary Text 2 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1103927)]. An alternative, attribute-driven clustering scheme for the 26,486 autosomal CpG loci was employed by grouping CpGs by epigenetically relevant bioinformatic attributes: CpG island (CGI) status, polycomb group (PcG) target status of the associated gene [i.e., gene was described as a PcG target in at least one of, and/or ], presence within 1 kb of at least one of 258 computationally predicted transcription factor binding site (TFBS) sequences obtained from the tfbsConsSites track of the University of CaliforniaâSanta Cruz (UCSC) Genomes Browser site (TFBS z-score &gt; 2), and localization within each of the following classes of repetitive element as defined by the Repeatmasker track of Genomes Browser: Alu, LINE-1, LINE-2, and mammalian wide-interspersed repeat elements (MIRs). This bioinformatic classification resulted in 41 distinct bioinformatic classes containing at least one CpG (see Supplemental Material, Table 2). For each subject, 41 corresponding aggregate methylation values were obtained by averaging together average Î²-values from all CpGs within the class.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">t1.xml</infon><infon key="id">t1</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table</infon><offset>12802</offset><text>Covariate (n = 380)	Linear regression effect estimate (95% CI)	p-Value

When considering class-specific relationships, there was a positive association between AluYb8 methylation levels and mean methylation across loci allocated within a PcG target gene and LINE-2 element and proximal to a TFBS (class PcG/LINE-2/TFBS) and loci located within a CGI and PcG target gene and proximal to a TFBS (class CpG/PcG/TFBS).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">ehp.1103927.g003.jpg</infon><infon key="id">f3</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>24336</offset><text>Association of LINE-1 (A) and AluYb8 (B) methylation with bioinformatically derived CpG class methylation.

To expand on the bioinformatically informed analysis, which suggested that methylation of CpG loci proximal to a TFBS were associated with AluYb8 methylation, we performed a GSEA using specific TFBS, obtained from the UCSC Genomes Browser. Specifically, each of the 26,486 autosomal CpG loci are simultaneously evaluated for their association with LINE-1 or AluYb8 methylation extent and the genomic locations or TFBS that are overrepresented within 1 kb of the loci [for the GSEA results, see Supplemental Material, Figure 2 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1103927)]. Only three TFBS genes were overrepresented among loci whose methylation was associated with LINE-1 methylation: MEF2, TBX1, and POU2F1. For those overrepresented among loci associated with AluYb8 methylation, there were a number of developmentally related TFBS genes (CUX1, CHX10, PAX4, PPARG, TAL1/ITF2 heterodimer, HAND1, MYOD, OCT), as well as those involved in cell processes (ACTR3B, S8), gene expression (NFE2L), lipid/sterol homeostasis (NR3C1), and immune modulation (GATA1). Only POU2F1 was found to be overrepresented among loci associated with both LINE-1 and AluYb8 methylation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>25848</offset><text>Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25859</offset><text>In this study, we have identified significant associations between infant growth, in utero exposures, and repetitive element methylation in placental tissue. Moreover, by examining the relationship between repetitive element DNA methylation and genomewide (array) gene-associated methylation, this work suggests potential epigenetic mechanisms underlying changes to placental function that may lead to altered fetal development and programming. In addition, we have identified particular regions of the genome susceptible to alterations by the intrauterine environment.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26429</offset><text>Overall, AluYb8 had higher DNA methylation levels than did LINE-1, which may be due to the lower degree of C-to-T transition mutations owing to the younger age of AluYb8 elements. AluYb8 levels were found to marginally differ by infant sex, which is consistent with the previous literature in that repetitive element methylation markers in blood may vary by sex. We found that birth weight percentile levels increased by about 10 and 15 points, respectively, with a 10% increase in LINE-1 or AluYb8 methylation levels, suggesting a strong association of repetitive element methylation markers with fetal growth. However, because LINE-1 and AluYb8 methylation levels have a moderate correlation, it is possible that these two repetitive element methylation markers may explain both similar and different sources of variation in infant growth. Our analysis of the relationship between the extent of methylation at these elements and genomewide gene-associated methylation was aimed to better characterize the similarities and differences in the potential functional importance of these markers.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27522</offset><text>The approach to examining the relationship between repetitive element methylation and gene-associated methylation was not designed to assess specific loci or genes associated with LINE-1 or AluYb8 methylation, but rather to evaluate whether methylation of particular groups of CpG loci with like methylation patterns or similar bioinformatic attributes were coordinately associated with LINE-1 or AluYb8 methylation, because this could inform on the process responsible for the variation between the two. Based on our data-driven RPMM approach, we observed that AluYb8 methylation was significantly and positively correlated with methylation at CpG loci in an intermediately methylated class containing loci that were located predominantly within CGIs and associated with PcG target genes. This was further substantiated in our bioinformatically informed classification analysis, because we identified a significant association between AluYb8 methylation and methylation of a group of loci defined by their position in a CGI, PcG target gene, and a TFBS, as well CpGs defined by association with a PcG target gene and LINE-2 element and proximal to a TFBS. We did not observe an overall association between any attribute-defined gene-associated class methylation and LINE-1 methylation levels. This is in contrast to a previous study involving 12 fetal cord blood samples, which reported a significant correlation between LINE-1 methylation and methylation of specific loci residing mostly in CGIs. This disparity may reflect tissue-specific differences in these relationships, as well as the larger and therefore more precise nature of our examination. PcG targets are a family of developmentally related genes that can remodel chromatin and are responsible for silencing HOX genes, which are critical in embryonic development as well as potentially hundreds of other genes involved in cellular differentiation. We observed that increasing AluYb8 methylation was associated with greater extents of methylation at CpG loci located in a PcG target, and thus a change in the extent of methylation of AluYb8 may represent an alteration in the methylation of these key loci important in tissue development and differentiation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29745</offset><text>Both bioinformatically informed CpG classes that were significantly associated with AluYb8 methylation contained loci that are proximal to TFBSs. Upon further exploration through GSEA, we observed an overrepresentation of several TFBSs for transcription factors critical in development, cellular processes, immune modulation, lipid or sterol homeostasis, and gene expression near loci associated with AluYb8, as well as a few developmental and cellular proliferation pathways for LINE-1. Specifically, POU2F1 binding sites were overrepresented among loci associated with both LINE-1 and AluYb8 extent. This transcription factor plays a role in the control of a wide range of genes, including small nuclear RNAs, immunoglobulins, histone H2B, and the glucocorticoid receptor, and thus has a central role in controlling various functions, including those of immunomodulation and steroid homeostasis in the placenta. Taken together, these results suggest that alterations to LINE-1 or AluYb8 methylation may act as a marker for key changes to the extent of methylation at loci targeted by important transcription factors for normal development and placenta processes necessary for appropriate growth.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30943</offset><text>When looking at each repetitive element methylation marker grouped by various in utero exposures, we found that mean AluYb8 methylation levels were significantly different by maternal tobacco use during pregnancy, similar to results from another group that found significantly different levels of cytosine methylation by smoking status. Furthermore, mean LINE-1 methylation levels were significantly different by maternal alcohol use during pregnancy; however, limited numbers may affect our precision, so this result should be confirmed in further analyses. This study was limited in its assessment of environmental exposures because of the low number of exposed individuals and low power, making this part of our analysis largely exploratory in nature. However, it will be increasingly important to examine, in larger studies, how additional specific exposures, such as lead as has been done by previous researchers, during intrauterine development affect these epigenetic markers in a more quantitative way.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31954</offset><text>Although a few other studies have correlated array-based methylation levels with repetitive element methylation markers and found at times good correlation between the two, our results indicate that array-based methylation level may not be a good predictive marker of repetitive element methylation level in human placenta tissue. Array-based mean methylation across the 26,486 CpG loci was not found to be associated with any of our in utero exposures, contrasting with our repetitive element methylation markers. Additionally, LINE1, AluYb8, and specific array-based methylation loci often interrogate different genetic regions; therefore, their methylation may have a differential genomic impact. Furthermore, the divergence of results observed between LINE-1 and AluYb8 reported throughout this work suggests that these repetitive element methylation markers are distinct measures and may not represent true, and potentially interchangeable, surrogates of âglobalâ methylation. Although we found that these repetitive element indicators are weakly to moderately correlated, they have their own unique distributions of methylation values, consistent with previous comparisons between LINE-1 and Alu methylation in normal blood. In addition, it is believed that genomic location and sequence context play a crucial role in the maintenance or loss of DNA methylation in these regions. For example, research has suggested that Alu sequences often flank CGIs and therefore may play a distinct role in both repetitive element and gene-directed methylation. Differences between these markers can most likely be explained by the unequal distributions of these sequences throughout the genome, owing in some part to the evolutionary age of these two retrotransposable elements. This may therefore be affecting the number of these elements in the genome and the functional relevance of their methylation, particularly in the placenta. As our results suggest, distinct mechanisms and selective pressures are likely responsible for their alteration.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34000</offset><text>The strengths of this study include the large sample size, population-based ascertainment of placenta samples, quantitative assessment of LINE-1 and AluYb8 methylation, and the use of a well-established, high-density methylation array for methylation profiling. Modest limitations of this study include the use of data from medical records, which may have reduced the quality of covariate data used in this study. This may have been especially relevant in our measurement of maternal tobacco, alcohol, and prenatal vitamin use and could have potentially introduced a bias toward the null. Additionally, because Rhode Island is a small state representing a small geographic area, recruiting participants from this state may affect the generalizability of our findings; however, because the Women and Infants Hospital performs &gt; 85% of all obstetrical deliveries in Providence County (the largest population center in Rhode Island), we believe this limitation is compensated for to some extent by the lack of ascertainment bias in this population-based study.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>35058</offset><text>Conclusions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>35070</offset><text>Overall, we have demonstrated that altered methylation of repetitive elements in the placenta is associated with birth outcome and with specific environmental exposures encountered by the fetus. Of course, birth weight is likely a proxy for a complex interplay of underlying etiologic mechanisms and environmental factors that overall contribute to infant health at birth and beyond. Our data also suggest that these alterations may reflect underlying functional epigenetic alterations to genes important in placental growth and development. Confirmation and expansion of these findings in additional populations, with additional environmental data and more comprehensive methylation profiles as well as studies of the mechanism of these alterations, will provide additional valuable insights into the epigenetic mechanisms controlling fetal growth. These data also further the hypothesis that the intrauterine environment acting through epigenetic alteration of the placenta is a key mechanism to explain the developmental origins of health and disease and suggest that enhanced examinations of the importance of placental epigenetic variation in health outcomes should be undertaken.</text></passage><passage><infon
