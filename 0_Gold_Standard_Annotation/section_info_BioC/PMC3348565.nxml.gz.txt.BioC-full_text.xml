Two hospital-based case-control studies in Ethiopia and India suggest that vitamin D deficiency might substantially increase the risk of severe pneumonia in children. Our systematic review identified one randomised placebo controlled trial relating pneumonia or lower respiratory infections to vitamin D deficiency supplementation in young children. This trial of 100â000 IU (2Â·5 mg) vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) supplementation along with antibiotic treatment of children younger than 3 years with clinically diagnosed pneumonia in Kabul showed no difference in the time to recovery between the groups. However, the risk of repeated pneumonia in the subsequent 3 months was 13% (relative risk [RR] 0Â·78, 95% CI 0Â·64â0Â·94; p=0Â·01) lower in the vitamin D3 compared with the placebo group. Other more recent studies assessing different outcomes in children or adults have conflicting findings on the effectiveness of vitamin D.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2965</offset><text>There is growing evidence of the vitamin D parancrine system enhancing innate immunity: the activation of Toll-like receptors on monocytes and macrophages by microbial pathogens results in increased expression of CYP27B1 and vitamin D receptor (VDR) genes within these cells. In the presence of adequate concentrations of calcifediol (25-hydroxyvitamin D), CYP27B1 leads to an increase synthesis of intracellular calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D). The binding of this to vitamin D receptors in turn results in increased intracellular formation of antimicrobial compounds, such as cathelicidins. The generation of intracellular antimicrobial compounds is impaired in patients who are vitamin D deficient (ie, low serum concentrations of calcifediol). It has been suggested that vitamin D might be used in the treatment of opportunistic and antibiotic-resistant infections.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3840</offset><text>There is debate between investigators regarding concentrations that relate to optimum stores of vitamin D in the body. In children, serum calcifediol concentrations should be maintained at 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) or greater for skeletal benefits. Vitamin D deficiency rickets in children younger than 5 years is an endemic problem in developing countries, ranging from 5â45%, even where sunlight is abundant, and has also re-emerged in some developed countries.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4301</offset><text>In people, the main source of vitamin D is through the action of ultraviolet B radiation on 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin, with small amounts derived from dietary sources. In Afghanistan, dietary intake of vitamin D is low and exposure of women to sunlight is limited by the widespread use of the burqa. Therefore, breastmilk, a normally poor source of vitamin D, becomes even more deficient. Furthermore, the common practice of swaddling infants might reduce exposure to sunlight. Thus young children are at a high risk of vitamin D deficiency. A cross-sectional survey during the high-risk winter months in 2005 showed that greater than 95% of children younger than 5 years in a socioeconomically deprived part of Kabul had serum calcifediol levels of less than 37Â·5 nmol/L.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5082</offset><text>On the basis of findings that vitamin D is an immunomodulator, that deficiency is a risk factor for pneumonia, and that quarterly supplementation had better compliance than daily or weekly supplementation, we aimed to test the hypothesis that quarterly 100â000 IU vitamin D supplementation would reduce the incidence of radiologically confirmed pneumonia by 35% in our study population.

Given that 73% of children had vitamin D deficiency in the study region in 2005, and that the incidence of pneumonia was ten-times higher in vitamin D deficient children than in children without a deficiency in case-control studies we postulated that there would be at least a 35% reduction in pneumonia incidence in the vitamin D compared with the placebo group.

To assess the potential problem of multicollinearity we used Pearsons correlation coefficient or Cramers V (for paired categorical variables). If a child was not seen for more than 45 days, at the two weekly visits, or at the hospital, they were censored for that period of our study. These children could re-enter the study when next seen. We calculated person-time at risk for each child up to the date a child reached our primary endpoint, was last seen at the end of our study, or when censored because they were lost to follow-up. For our intention-to-treat analysis we included all children randomly assigned to our study groups. For our per-protocol analysis we included children who in both groups received all doses with an interval between the doses of 60 and 120 days and had not violated the randomisation codes. We analysed the repeat episodes accounting for clustering within individuals. We made initial comparisons of time-to-an-episode between the two groups with log-rank tests and KaplanâMeier plots.

The ascertainment of study outcomes was robust, and done clinically through masked experienced and retrained paediatricians with Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses clinical definitions of pneumonia applied in other trials and radiologically through the interpretation of chest radiographs by masked, experienced, and external readers by use of WHO standards. Frequent home visits confirmed outcomes of interest. Supplementation raised the serum concentration of calcifediol in the intervention group at several points in our study. Thus the lack of a protective effect of vitamin D against pneumonia is probably not due to misclassification of outcomes or inadequate supplementation. Any misclassification of other causes of raised respiratory rate as pneumonia, under-reporting, or over-reporting would be distributed equally between the two groups since the families, doctors, radiographers, radiologists, and data entry staff were masked to the randomisation groupings and the randomisation was successful since the characteristics were balanced between the two groups. However, a limitation due to the high-risk nature of our population is that the generalisability of our findings to populations with low-to-moderate risk of vitamin deficiency is unknown. There were fewer deaths than we predicted in both groups, possibly due to the intense health surveillance possible during our study. Genotyping, which was not practical in our study setting, might have aided the interpretation of our findings, as shown in a vitamin D supplementation trial for tuberculosis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21546</offset><text>We accounted for nutritional factors through a diet questionnaire, weight at recruitment, and growth comparison at the end of our studyâany nutritional deficiencies would have been equally balanced between the two groups.

Nevertheless, there was a higher (adequate level) mean serum concentration of calcifediol at the end of first supplementation period in the intervention group compared with the lower (not adequate) mean concentrations in the placebo group (data not shown).

Our sample testing suggest that the vitamin D group maintained above mean adequate vitamin D concetrations verses consistently low concentrations in the placebo group. It can be argued that a steady-state adequate vitamin D concentration was not reached in some children because of fluctuations in serum concentrations due to our study regimen. Although this is probably true, a sufficient serum concentrations for the immunological effects of vitamin D is unknown and could be higher or lower than that of the skeletal system accepted concentrations.

A systematic review of the role of vitamin D supplementation in infectious diseases had mixed findings, concluding that more rigorously designed clinical trials are needed (panel). No studies report the effect of vitamin D on radiologically confirmed pneumonias. Other trials assessing infections of the upper respiratory tract also had mixed findings: one trial in post-menopausal women identified reduced self-reported episodes of infection of the upper respiratory tract, specifically in winter, whereas two others in elderly and general adults did not identify a difference between the groups with regards to self-reported episodes. One trial in schoolchildren (measuring influenza A antigen from swabs) found a statistically significant reduced incidence in the intervention group (RR 0Â·58, 95% CI 0Â·34â0Â·99).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24372</offset><text>The benefits of supplementation for tuberculosis are similarly unclear. One paediatric trial showed 16% higher rates of tuberculosis symptom resolution, an adult trial showed 23% greater sputum conversion rate at 6 months, another trial showed 20% greater restriction of BCG-lux growth in blood, another trial found accelerated sputum conversion only in a certain genotype of the sample, whereas yet another found no significant difference in sputum conversion in the intervention compared with the placebo group. Vitamin D is linked with other non-bone health outcomes, but the few completed and adequately powered trials assessing the effect of supplementation have mixed findings in improving outcomesâie, cancers, vascular disease, and diabetes. As in our studies, these inconsistent findings point to the existence of complicated pathways for the function of vitamin D in disease processes, or simply that the correct effective dose of vitamin D supplementation needs to be better defined. The optimum concentrations of vitamin D for adults and children are based on non-immunological and, mostly, bone outcomes. An associated issue is that, after the start of our trial, speculations arose that high fluctuations of natural or supplemented vitamin D intake might be linked to negative outcomes. These speculations relate two studies in which supplementation of a single large dose (300â000 or 500â000 IU) of vitamin D for reducing fractures in elderly women led to an increase in fractures, plus similar discrepancies in prostate cancer research with vitamin D. Our findings and particularly the slightly higher repeat episodes of pneumonia in the vitamin D group could be due to such fluctuations if the hypothesis is true. If so, then in terms of policy and guidelines, it is hard to know what regimen to recommend for future trials, given that clinical practice and evidence suggests that daily or weekly supplementations though ideal are not complied with and are impractical for families, especially in developing countries, and food fortification at the population level will not be an option during exclusive breastfeeding periods (aged &lt;6 months), nor is it likely to be adequate in highly deficient populations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26605</offset><text>Alternately, it might be that immunological effectiveness of supplementation is highly dependent upon other factors as yet unidentified, or other prevalent factors in this high-risk population (for example, other malnutrition factors and that 5Â·5% of the children in our study had a Z score of weight for age below â3). Further questions arise with respect to the previous treatment trial in the same region of Kabul, which showed that a single high-dose supplementation with 100â000 IU vitamin D3 given orally to young children, along with antibiotic treatment at the time of diagnosis, reduced repeat episodes of pneumonia in the subsequent 3 months. The inconsistent results could be related to the evidence that stimulation of Toll-like receptors on macrophages and monocytes by bacterial antigens is important in up-regulation of CYP27B1 and the vitamin D receptor, which are crucial in production of cathelicidins in vitamin-D-depleted individuals. In other words, this system might not be effective unless there is existing infection with pathogens when vitamin D supplementation is given. Finally, any possible reduction in the incidence of pneumonia in our trial might be restricted to only certain genotypes as recorded in a single tt genotype after the start of our trial in a study of tuberculosis. Both the pneumonia treatment and the population supplementation trials need to be repeated in other settings for confirmation, and frequent determination of serum calcifediol concentrations might guide the interpretation of the findings.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28159</offset><text>As with the trials in the older children, giving higher doses of vitamin D, we too did not record any adverse effects associated with vitamin D supplementation. However, the number of children and the length of follow-up involved in these studies could only detect common and early adverse effects. Although vitamin D overload is a theoretical possibility, 100â000 IU of vitamin D3 has been shown to provide the best protection against vitamin D deficiency without overload or side-effects in high-risk infants aged 0â9 months with normal baseline ranges of vitamin D. Furthermore, single intramuscular injection of three times this dose (300â000 IU) was safe in treating nutritional rickets in 6â30-month-old children residing in lower socioeconomic regions of sunny Istanbul. Higher than recommended doses of daily supplementation of vitamin D (500â1000 IU per day, adding up to 120â000 IU over 3 months) plus additional milk fortified with vitamin D, has been shown not to induce an overload, including in infants starting with normal ranges of vitamin D, even when supplementation continued during the summer (in France) and when mothers had antenatal vitamin D supplementation. It is important to note that in our study, where community supplementation was in a population with known high rates of vitamin D deficiency, 1% of children tested had a calcifediol concentration greater than 375 nmol/Lâthought undesirably high. Although these did not produce any clinical signs and symptoms, these measurements raise a need for caution with doses for population supplementation. The speculative negative role of fluctuations is vitamin D needs to be considered with caution until further evidence is available.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29885</offset><text>We have shown that a quarterly 100â000 IU supplementation of vitamin D3 did not reduce the incidence of pneumonias in children living in regions with high vitamin D deficiency.

We did not limit our searches by language or date. No studies reported on radiologically confirmed pneumonias. One masked placebo trial assessed the effect of bolus supplementation of vitamin D3 in a high-risk population clinically diagnosed with pneumonia (100â000 IU [2Â·5 mg] vitamin D3 [cholecalciferol] supplementation along with antibiotic treatment to children younger than 3 years) in Kabul. Treatment had no effect on the time to recovery but reduced the risk of clinically defined pneumonia 13% up to 3 months after treatment. Trials assessing infections of the upper respiratory tract had mixed findings: one trial in post-menopausal women identified a reduction in self-reported episodes of infections during winter, whereas two other studies in adults did not identify effects on self-reported episodes. One trial in schoolchildren noted a 42% reduction in the risk of influenza A by use of antigen titre as a proxy measure. The reported in-vitro and case-control studies suggest a link between respiratory infections and vitamin D as an immunoregulator, but the evidence on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on acute respiratory infections is conflicting. Given that pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality in young children, the effects of vitamin D supplementation to infants on the incidence of pneumonia merits investigation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>41632</offset><text>Interpretation</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>41647</offset><text>Our findings show that bolus quarterly supplementation of 100â000 IU vitamin D3 did not reduce the rate or severity of radiologically confirmed or clinically defined pneumonia. This finding is surprising in view of evidence suggesting an association between vitamin D deficiency and respiratory infections. However, our findings are similar to some previous studies on the effect of supplementation on infections of the upper respiratory tract or other outcomes such as bone fractures, cancers, and heart disease, and they contribute to the debate on factors that determine the immunological effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation.</text></passage></document></collection>
