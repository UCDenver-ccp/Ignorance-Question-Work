Guidelines from Australia, Europe and the USA encourage fish consumption during pregnancy. The potential for contamination by heavy metals, as well as risk of listeriosis requires careful consideration of the shaping of dietary messages related to fish intake during pregnancy. This review critically evaluates literature on fish intake in pregnant women, with a focus on the association between neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring and maternal fish intake during pregnancy. Peer-reviewed journal articles published between January 2000 and March 2014 were included. Eligible studies included those of healthy pregnant women who had experienced full term births and those that had measured fish or seafood intake and assessed neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring. Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect and the Cochrane Library were searched using the search terms: pregnant, neurodevelopment, cognition, fish and seafood. Of 279 papers sourced, eight were included in the final review. Due to heterogeneity in methodology and measured outcomes, a qualitative comparison of study findings was conducted. This review indicates that the benefits of diets providing moderate amounts of fish during pregnancy outweigh potential detrimental effects in regards to offspring neurodevelopment. It is important that the type of fish consumed is low in mercury.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1557</offset><text>1. Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1573</offset><text>Fish is a source of several nutrients that are important during pregnancy for healthy foetal development including iodine, long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn-3PUFAs), and vitamins A, D and B12. Guidelines from Australia, Europe and the USA encourage the consumption of fish during pregnancy. Recent studies indicate that pregnant women lack sufficient knowledge regarding the importance of iodine and LCn-3 PUFAs, nutrients that are present in fish and seafood. In addition, it appears Australian women are falling short of LCn-3PUFA intake recommendations during pregnancy. On average, Australian women are consuming 33 g of fish per day and pregnant women an average of 28 g of fish per day, below Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) recommended intakes. As well as being a source of essential nutrients, fish are also a potential source of contaminants including mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins. Guidelines emphasising the health risks of methyl-mercury, with little mention of important nutrients found in fish, may be contributing to women consuming less than the recommended fish servings during pregnancy. Thus the risks and benefits resulting from fish consumption need to be considered and scientific evidence should direct advice given to pregnant women to help them make the safest choice.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2915</offset><text>There are many documented health benefits from fish consumption with regard to foetal health, including improved neurodevelopment, increased birth weight and a reduced risk of spontaneous abortion. This review focuses on neurodevelopmental outcomes for the foetus as much of the published research into fish consumption during pregnancy has focused on methyl-mercury, LCn-3PUFAs and iodine, all known to impact foetal neurodevelopment. The aim of this review was to critically appraise literature investigating fish intake in pregnant women to assess the hypothesis that fish consumption during pregnancy positively influences foetal neurodevelopment. This review concludes with a discussion highlighting some of the methodological issues in researching associations between diet and infant neurodevelopment.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>3724</offset><text>2.

Population	Pregnant women living in Bristol &amp; surrounds, United Kingdom (UK).	Pregnant women recruited in Massachusetts, United States of America (USA)	Pregnant women in Bristol &amp; surrounds, UK.	Pregnant women recruited in Southampton, UK.
Nâsample size	7421 mother-child pairs.	135 mother-child pairs	5449 children assessed.	217 mother-child pairs.
Method	Measured fish intake during at 32 weeks gestation by Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) during. Breastfeeding, child fish consumption, maternal dental &amp; lifestyle questionnaires. Neurodevelopmental testing of child completed by mother using ALSPAC adaption of the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory (MCDI) at 15 months and Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST) at 18 months of age.	Fish and seafood intake measured via a validated FFQ (calibrated for LCn-3PUFAs in blood) at 28 weeks gestation. Infant cognition measured using Visual Recognition Memory (VRM) paradigm at 6 months of age.	Seafood consumption assessed at 32 weeks gestation via FFQ. Postal questionnaires on diet, education, social, behavioural and developmental outcomes at child age: 6, 18, 30, 42, and 81 months. Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children III used to assess Intelligence Quotient (IQ) at 8 years and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) conducted. Presented as percentage of children in the lowest quartile for WISC-III and ALSPAC development test subscales or in the suboptimum range of behavioural scores for the SDQ. Tested at 42 months, 7 and 8 years.	Two FFQs during pregnancy (at 15 weeks and 32 weeks) were used to estimate fish intake in early and late pregnancy. Cognitive &amp; behavioural outcomes in offspring at 9 years using the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence. The SDQ was used to measure maladaptive behaviour.
Intervention/comparator	Fish intake: rarely/never, once a fortnight, 1â3 times per week, 4 or more times per week. Assumed each fish serve was 4.5 ounces (~0 g, 64 g, 255 g and 510 g per week).	Second trimester fish servings: more than 2 weekly fish servings compared to 2 or less. Did not convert servings to grams.	Comparing no seafood intake and 1â340 g per week with more than 340 g per week (3 servings is estimated as 340 g).	Fish servings per week in early and late pregnancy: never, less than 1, 1â2 times, 3 or more times. Oily fish servings in both early and late pregnancy: never, less than 1, 1 or more. Amount not specified in grams
Outcome	Fish consumption during pregnancy resulted in modest but significant improvement in developmental scores for language &amp; social activity at 15â18 months age. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for high test score for MCDI: Vocabulary comprehension = 1.5 (1.1â2.0) for one or more serves compared to no serves. Social activity = 1.6 (1.2â2.2) for 1/fortnight, 1.7 (1.3â2.2) for 1â3/week and 1.8 (1.4â2.4) for 4+ serves/week compared to no serves.	Non-significant increase in VRM of 2.8 points for each additional weekly fish serving (95% CI = 0.2 to 5.4). When mercury confounder was adjusted for, this association became significant: 4.0 (1.3 to 6.7).Mothers consuming greater than 2 fish serves per week had infants with the greatest VRM scores.	Seafood intake during pregnancy was associated with a significant reduction in percentage of children with suboptimal IQ and behaviour test scores in 9 of 23 outcomes. Non-seafood consumers during pregnancy had children who scored lower on tests of verbal IQ at 8 years: OR (CI) for no seafood = 1.48 (1.16â1.90); some seafood 1.09 (0.92â1.20) compared with &gt;340 g per week [overall trend: p = 0.004].	Oily fish consumption more than once per week versus no oily fish reduced the risk of hyperactivity. No association with fish consumption in early pregnancy and full scale IQ, however, total fish intake in late pregnancy of 1 to 2 serves per week was associated with having a child with higher IQ at age 9 years. Higher intakes (3 or more serves per week) did not show a statistically significant improvement. Regression coefficients (95% CI) for fish consumption and full scale IQ: less than once per week vs. no fish = 7.76 (0.38 to 15.1), once or twice per week vs. no fish = 6.91 (0.19 to 13.6). Verbal IQ &amp; fish consumption: Increase of 7.32 (0.26 to 14.4) with fish consumption once or twice per week. 8.07 (0.28 to 15.9) with three or more serves per week.

Nâsample size	25,446 mothers-child pairs.	341 mother-child pairs.	392 mother-child pairs	498 mother-infant pairs
Method	Validated FFQ conducted at 25 weeks gestation to estimate fish intake. Standardised interview with mother used to assess child neurodevelopment at 6 and 18 months. Measured the odds of improved development scores due to fish intake. No individual comparison for each categoryâpooled estimate only.	Fish intake during pregnancy estimated via semi-quantitative FFQ. Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) and Wide Range Assessment of Visual Motor Abilities (WRAVMA) tested at ~38 months age of child and analysed for association with fish intake.	FFQ of typical diet during pregnancy completed 3 months after delivery and fish and shellfish/squid intake estimated. Neurodevelopment (as well as diet and physical activity) assessed when child was 4 years of age using the McCarthy Scales of Childrenâs Abilities (MCSA) testsâglobal cognitive scale &amp; 5 subscales (perceptive-performance, memory, verbal, quantitative and motor).	Fish intake measured via FFQ 4 days after birth of child. Trained examiners conducted Neurodevelopmental testing of child was completed via a Neonatal Behavioural Assessment 3 days post birth (28 behavioural &amp; 18 reflex items).
Comparator and Comparison	Fish intake in quintiles Weekly servings Categories: no fish (0 g), 1â2 servings (1â340 g per week), or 3 or more servings per week (over 340 g).	Fish consumption: No fish serves, less than or equal to 2 servings per week, greater than 2 servings per week.	Maternal fish intake of more than 2â3 times per week compared to up to once per week. No mention of intake in grams.	Maternal seafood intake in grams (average intake = 300â360 g per week).
Outcome	Highest 3 quintiles of fish intake resulted in improved motor, social/cognitive and total development scores at 18 months: OR (95%CI) = 1.28 (1.20, 1.38) for highest versus lowest quintile. This association was less obvious at 6 months (only the highest quintile showed significant improvement).	Offspring of women who ate fish more than twice a week scored significantly higher on WRAVMA drawing and total scores compared with no serves. OR (95%CI) for WRAVMA drawing = 6.0 (1.8, 10.2) for more than two serves per week compared with no serves. WRAVMA total score = 5.3 (0.9, 9.6) for more than two serves per week compared to no serves.	Pregnant women fish consumption greater than 2â3 times per week had children with significantly higher cognition and motor development scores compared to women consuming fish less than once a week. This association was only significant in children breastfed for up to 6 months. Greater than 3 serves per week was not associated with improved outcomes.	Seafood intake weakly (p = 0.1) correlated with motor development. Other measures of neurodevelopment not significant in either direction.

Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18589</offset><text>This systematic review of observational cohort studies demonstrates an association between consumption of one or more servings of fish per week during pregnancy and better offspring neurodevelopment outcomes. Suzuki et al. was the only study to report a neutral effect of seafood intake on all neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, in that study neurodevelopment was assessed when the infant was only three days old. The seven studies, which demonstrated a benefit in neurodevelopment, had a follow up time ranging from six months to nine years. Thus it is possible that longer follow up may be needed to determine significant associations. This concept is supported by Oken et al. which found an improvement in neurodevelopmental scores at six months in only the highest quintile of fish intake while this improvement was evident in the highest three quintiles at eighteen months.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>19471</offset><text>Mendez et al. found that seafood consumption that excluded fish intake had a detrimental effect on neurodevelopment, while fish intake alone led to improved outcomes. Thus it is possible that the study of Suzuki et al. may have detected a benefit had fish been considered separately from total seafood. Gale et al. reported differences in outcomes associated with oily fish intake and total fish intake in early compared to late pregnancy. This suggests that the type of fish and timing of consumption during pregnancy may impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes of offspring. However, this information is limited to a single study, which was conducted in a relatively small sample (n = 217). More research in this area is required to draw sound conclusions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20228</offset><text>It is important to note the number methodological limitations in research on diet and infant neurodevelopment that are present in these studies.

All identified observational cohort studies in the current review used food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) to assess fish intake. No studies reported adjusting results from the FFQ for energy intake, a recommendation made by Freedman et al. 2011 to prevent attenuation. Three studies reported on the frequency of consumption without specifying the weight of fish servings while the remaining studies made assumptions based on standard serving sizes, as to the quantity of fish consumed at each occasion. This limits the accuracy of a quantifiable conclusion as due to individual variability in the perception of a âserving sizeâ.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21328</offset><text>Assessing cognitive development differences in infancy and childhood is fraught with difficulties due to the nature of childhood development and the accurate measurement of such. Firstly, children develop in âspurtsâ rather than in a continuous fashion, which means they may slip in and out of the ânormalâ reference ranges, particularly in the earlier years. To combat this, it has been suggested that testing occurs at more than one time point and that testing should extend beyond the first two years, preferable to school aged children in order to detect more subtle differences. Only 4 studies tested at multiple time points, four beyond two years, and only two looked at children of school age.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22037</offset><text>Secondly, there are multiple interrelated factors which impact on neurodevelopment, and not all confounders were accounted for in all analyses. Maternal intelligence, alcohol consumption, smoking and breastfeeding practices were included as covariates in all studies. However, factors including ethnicity, paternal intelligence, the home environment, drug use, dietary patterns, supplement use and maternal responsiveness were not always measured. The ALSPAC study reports by Daniels et al. and Hibbeln et al. included the home environment as a confounder, but not paternal IQ. Conversely, the two studies by Oken et al. adjusted for paternal IQ but not the home environment. The remaining four studies did not correct for either paternal IQ or home environment. No studies adjusted for maternal responsiveness which has been shown to be related to developmental outcomes independent of sociodemographic factors. An intake of fish may reflect a health conscious diet and thus the positive effects may not be directly attributed to the fish but rather to the diet as a whole. Oken et al. considered maternal diet by classifying women as following a âprudentâ or âwesternâ dietary pattern. Hibbeln et al. also adjusted for maternal diet, while Mendez et al. adjusted for both maternal and child diets. Other studies did not effectively account for dietary intake and are thus at risk of bias. Oken et al., Mendez et al. and Hibbeln et al. measured supplement usage during pregnancy. Hibbeln et al. reported that only 1.7% of women consumed fish oil supplements not affecting outcomes, however, this study did not consider supplements other than fish oil. Only Mendez et al. included supplement usage as a confounder.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23760</offset><text>There is no universal standard for which neurodevelopmental tests are most appropriate for use in children of varying ages and at what age meaningful differences in neurocognitive development can be detected. Performance in assessments can be significantly altered if the participant is hungry, tired or fearful of being in a strange place or being tested. The accuracy of the tests for the population depends on when the test was standardised and within what population. In particular the Denver test, utilised in the ALSPAC study has been criticised for its low specificity and potentially outdated ânormâ as it was standardised in 1980. Research on the reliability of parental reports on child development is conflicting, Daniels et al., Hibbeln et al. and Oken et al. used developmental testing carried out by the mother and thus results may not be as reliable as those reported by other studies, which used trained professionals.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24699</offset><text>Due to the risks associated with consuming fish and seafood during pregnancy related to food safety and heavy metal contamination, pregnant women may question the necessity of including these foods in their diets, when nutrition supplements are readily accessible in Western countries. A systematic review of randomised control trials examining LCn-3PUFA supplementation during pregnancy found no clear association between supplement use and infant cognitive outcomes. This may be attributable to the synergistic effects of food and associated with fish being a source of other nutrients which are important for infant development such as iodine and vitamin D. Presently, there have been no randomised control trials examining neurocognitive outcomes associated with prenatal multivitamin use and infant neurodevelopment, and these are unlikely to occur given ethical implications of such. Recent research has suggested that effects of methyl-mercury on infant brain development may be mediated by LCn-3PUFA. Because it is possible to consume fish and seafood safely during pregnancy, through following recommendations to limit high mercury species, it is prudent to recommend that pregnant women consume these foods, rather than rely on supplementation, in order to maximise infant neurodevelopment outcomes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>26009</offset><text>5. Conclusions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26024</offset><text>This review assessed the hypothesis that fish intake during pregnancy improves offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes. A review of the available evidence indicates that intake of fish during pregnancy is associated with positive foetal neurodevelopmental outcomes, as supported by seven of eight articles reviewed, which showed a beneficial impact on foetal neurodevelopment with one or more servings of fish per week compared with no fish intake. Based on the results from these observational studies the current recommendation of two to three servings per week appears appropriate. Randomised clinical trials have been conducted using fish oil supplementation in pregnancy, but not with fish considered as a whole food. Existing evidence is currently insufficient to inform advice regarding fish intake during pregnancy.
