One third of respondents (30.1%) attended a health centre out of their catchment health area with Buea Town health centre receiving the highest proportion of women out of the health area (56.8% of attendees). Knowledge about antenatal care varied and majority of respondents (96.4%) were satisfied with the antenatal services received. However, there were elements of dissatisfaction with health centre services, poor sitting facilities, amenities, few health education talks and poor nursing skills. High educational level (high school and university) (X2 = 8.714; p = 0.01) and first time pregnancy(X2= 4.217; p= 0.04) were significantly associated with poor satisfaction.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract_title_1</infon><offset>1582</offset><text>Conclusion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1593</offset><text>Policy makers should implement changes in the health care delivery system taking into account the usersâ preferences, more so in the light of increasing female education in Cameroon.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1778</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1791</offset><text>The fifth Millennium Development Goal (MDG), âImprovement of Maternal Healthâ has Antenatal Care (ANC) coverage or attendance as a progress indicator.

However, the perspective is changing from one of not just needing any service to one in which quality is a key component in health care provision. In Cameroon, there are few reported studies on the quality of ANC services rendered; meanwhile the study of consumer perceptions in relation to behavioral outcomes has been on the rise in other countries. This study is therefore designed to investigate pregnant women's perception of quality of ANC services rendered in health facilities within the Buea Health District area.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>2958</offset><text>Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2966</offset><text>The cross sectional study was carried out in the Buea Health District, one of the 18 health districts in the South West Region of Cameroon with an estimated population of 86,272 inhabitants.

This observation is similar to that seen in Uganda and Zimbabwe where it was also shown that the quality of care provided was contributory. Some of the respondents (25.6%) were recommended an ANC site. Of these, 49.6% recommendations were made by friends and neighbors (12.4%) mother or sister (12.4%) and husband (10%). This illustrates the importance of previous contact with a facility to determine further use. Here, the perception of the past users is the only driving tool to refer. The husband has been shown to play a significant role in determining the choice of ANC site by the woman in a Nigerian and Ugandan study where they accounted for 43% and 32% of all recommendations respectively. Evaluation of the reasons why 55.2% of respondents changed their ANC site, revealed that the change of residence, closeness to the health facility and the quality of care offered at the previous site were the predominant reasons.

However, attitudes are changing towards the âminimum of 4 visitsâ recommended by the WHO after the work of Nigenda et al and Langer et al. in resource limited settings like the study area.

In marked contrast, the Kenyan study by Ouma and collaborators and that in Nigeria by Dairo and Owoyokun found that only 10.4% and up to 89.6% of pregnant women were informed of pregnancy danger signs respectively. In our setting, family planning and care of the newborn are usually discussed in Infant Welfare Clinic. This accounts for the low rate of these health talks in this study as opposed to other studies.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20065</offset><text>Respondents rated the services provided at the health centres generally as satisfactory. The activities carried out in the health centres were similar in the institutions involved in the study. The services offered were acceptable in contrast with observations from other studies in Sub-Saharan countries such as in Uganda by Cham et al and that by van Eijket al in Kenya where for example, urine and serological tests are not routinely done. In a Nigerian study by Fawoleet al and in Entebe, a semi-urban district in Uganda a proportionately similar profile of ANC services were offered as in our area of study.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>20678</offset><text>With regards to waiting time at the clinic, the women recognized that most of the time wasting was due to late coming of their fellow pregnant women. However, dissatisfaction abounded with respect to this aspect, especially for women of higher educational levels. They were impatient because they claimed they had other preoccupations. Furthermore, respondents had some reservations with respect to the sitting comfort in some health centres, complaining that the benches were too hard and lacked back-rests. The women with high level of education and women attending for their first pregnancies were not satisfied with the competence of the staff. Most of them recommended an improvement in the nursesâ skills. However, women attending for their subsequent pregnancies and those at their third or more visits were more tolerant of the services provided at the health centres. This is probably because their contact with the health system had tailored their expectations and they expressed satisfaction with the existing services.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21711</offset><text>There were significant differences between primigravida or multigravida and the educational levels on the aspect of the comprehensiveness of health talks. Women attending ANC for their subsequent pregnancies probably had a notion of what health topics were discussed during clinic sessions and so their objectives at ANC were not only aimed at acquiring knowledge about diet, danger signs and other topics but also in the state of their babies. Primigravida on the contrary expected vital information from the health talks to help them cope well with their pregnancy and labor. Clients with a high educational level, were less satisfied with the health talks. They were more interested in having an indebt knowledge on how complications arising during pregnancy could be managed. The predominant topics discussed during health talks were hygiene and nutrition. There were post-natal lectures on the immediate care of the newborn and breastfeeding. Focusing on post-natal issues was not usually appealing to pregnant women who were more eager to learn about labor. However, an Australian study showed that both women and providers thought the time for antenatal classes was too small to incorporate all they had to learn with some women complaining of having received too much information.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23000</offset><text>The overall satisfaction of the women attending ANC in the study health district was high(91.4%). These results are similar to other studies of patient satisfaction; (96.5%) in Ibadan, Nigeria and 86.4% in Ogun State, Nigeria. However, it has been said that the views of pregnant women concerning their care is generally positive as they tend to be uncritical of healthcare, accepting whatever care they receive as appropriate. Thus using patient views to evaluate health care has been criticized, regarding their responses as a mixture of the healthcare performance measurement and the respondent's reflection. Nevertheless, patient views provide an insight to the care provided and the system as a whole. The influence of the educational level of respondents is predominant here as it is noticed that those at a high educational level are more likely to be critical about care received and defer a positive satisfaction. This issue was also revealed in Fawole and colleaguesâ study where they hypothesized that as the level of education in the community steadily increases, pregnant women may become more and more critical of health care. Hence there is a need to mobilize efforts for a better quality assessment in our health care provision with the aim of improving quality in terms of provision of health care services. Improvement must be made to attain a desired change and amelioration in our health care delivery package. The usersâ opinion has been sought here and it is noticed that they recommend ameliorations in the interpersonal interaction with staff in terms of more comprehensive health talks and improvement in nursing skills, better infrastructures(like good toilet facilities and comfortable sitting areas) and tolerable waiting times. A step in this direction will go a long way to consolidate the improvement in health care delivery sought by Cameroon in the framework of the MDGs.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>24909</offset><text>Conclusion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24920</offset><text>About one third of pregnant women in our study population attended an ANC site different from their local catchment area despite the availability of ANC in their residential area. Geographical accessibility was the main reason for choosing an ANC site, followed by perceived quality of care provided. Pregnant women in the Buea Health District have different knowledge about ANC which varies significantly among the pregnancy groups, number of visits and age. Most pregnant women were satisfied with the level of care received during ANC in public health centres in the Buea Health District. High educational level and primiparity are negatively associated with pregnant women's satisfaction of care received at ANC. Taken together, policy makers should implement changes in the health care delivery system taking into account the usersâ opinion, more so in the light of increasing female education in Cameroon.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">COMP_INT</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>25834</offset><text>Competing interests</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">COMP_INT</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25854</offset><text>The authors declare no competing interest.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">AUTH_CONT</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>25897</offset><text>Authorsâ contributions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">AUTH_CONT</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>25922</offset><text>Gregory Edie Halle Ekane: contributed in the research conception, analyzing and interpreting the data, writing of the manuscript and is the corresponding author.
