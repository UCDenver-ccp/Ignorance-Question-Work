Over the last two decades, there has been a substantial global reduction in under-5 child mortality rates. Compared to that, the reductions in neonatal deaths have been slower. Neonatal deaths accounted for 46% of all under-five deaths in 2016 compared with 37Â·4% in 1990. Effective interventions directed specifically at preventing neonatal deaths are required to improve overall child survival.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3150</offset><text>A systematic review in 2005 found that up to 70% of neonatal deaths, worldwide, could be averted by implementing sixteen evidence-based interventions at near universal coverage (99%) that incorporated preconception, antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal interventions.

Due to the high iron requirements for pregnancy, it is highly prevalent and severe in pregnant women. In Bangladesh, 42% of all women of reproductive age and nearly 50% of pregnant women had anaemia in 2011. However, the prevalence of iron deficiency was lower. The first national micronutrients status survey, published in early 2013, reported that iron deficiency among non-pregnant non-lactating women was 7.1%. The ferritin level was significantly higher in areas where groundwater iron concentration was high. The survey findings also suggest a positive association between natural iron content in groundwater and iron status of women.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4396</offset><text>There is strong evidence that maternal iron deficiency anaemia increases the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. However, most of the evidence is from observational epidemiological studies except for a very few randomised controlled trials. A community-based cluster randomised trial from China reported a 54% reduction of early neonatal mortality in newborns of women who received IFA supplements compared to those receiving folic acid alone (HR 0.46, 95%CI: 0.21â0.98). Secondary analyses of this trial found a 71% reduction in neonatal mortality in women who started IFA supplements in the first trimester of pregnancy (HR 0.29, 95%CI: 0.09â0.88). A meta-analysis of prospective observational studies, reported reductions in perinatal mortality (stillbirth and early neonatal mortality) with each 1Â g/dl increase in the population mean haemoglobin (RR 0.72, 95%CI: 0.65â0.81). A pooled analysis of data from Indonesian Demographic and Health Surveys, which included 40,576 singleton live-born infants, found mothers using any IFA supplements during pregnancy significantly reduced the risk of early neonatal death of their newborns after adjustment for potential confounders. Similarly, a pooled analysis from Pakistan on 8512 live births reported maternal antenatal IFA supplements significantly reduced the adjusted risk of death on day 0 by 33% and during the neonatal period by 29%. Initiating IFA supplements in the first four months of pregnancy, significantly reduced the adjusted risk of neonatal mortality by 35%.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5929</offset><text>IFA supplements have also been found to reduce the preterm delivery rate and neonatal mortality attributable to prematurity and birth asphyxia. Other studies from low-income countries have reported that preterm delivery is one of the main contributors to neonatal deaths. These results combined indicate that IFA supplements in populations of iron-deficient pregnant women could lead to a decrease in the number of neonatal deaths mediated by reduced rates of preterm delivery. We thus propose a large-scale prospective trial to measure the impact of the early introduction of antenatal iron/folic acid supplementation in pregnancy on neonatal outcomes in rural Bangladesh. We will employ a community-based, cluster randomized controlled trial design, in which pregnant women will be randomly allocated to the enhanced iron/folic acid distribution program, or to the current usual programs. We have chosen the current usual programs as our comparator. We didnât consider placebo because WHO and Government of Bangladesh have a recommendation that pregnant women should receive 60Â mg of iron supplementation. But the implementation of this recommendation is inadequate. Surveys indicate that only 52% of rural women reported any use of iron/folic acid in their last pregnancy but this dropped to 39% for the poorest households, and to 34% for women with no education (3). Also, the median gestation when women start antenatal care (and would have access to iron/folic acid supplements) is 5.2Â months (3) .</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>7438</offset><text>Objectives and hypothesis</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7464</offset><text>The trial objectives are to evaluate the effect of early availability and promotion of IFA supplements on neonatal mortality, low birthweight and preterm delivery. The primary hypothesis is that in a community-based, cluster randomized controlled trial of women from rural Bangladesh, daily supplementation with 60Â mg elemental iron and 400Â Î¼g folic acid starting in the first trimester of pregnancy, and sustained for at least 180Â days, will reduce neonatal mortality by 25% from 33/1000 to 24.8/1000 live births compared to usual iron-folic acid supplementation programs.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8042</offset><text>The secondary hypotheses are that the early availability and promotion of IFA supplements in intervention clusters will reduce preterm delivery by 30% (15% in control to 10.5% in intervention), and low birth weight by 30% (15% in control to 10.5% in intervention). We further hypothesised that household wealth and maternal education would modify the neonatal mortality responses with a greater reduction for women from the poorest households, and women with no education. We also hypothesised that the early start to IFA supplements would not increase iron-related side effects, e.g. nausea &amp; vomiting in intervention clusters and will be cost-effective in reducing neonatal mortality in intervention clusters.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>8754</offset><text>Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>8762</offset><text>Study design</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8775</offset><text>This study is a cluster randomised controlled trial, with 2-arm parallel groups, superiority design and 1:1 allocation ratio.

We explore womenâs and family membersâ perceptions of: cultural norms during pregnancy; birth weight; IFA supplementation; and experience using IFA supplements during pregnancy. We conducted the key informant interviews to understand the community norms around IFA supplementation, and challenges and successes of the existing programme. We used FGDs to understand both perceptions regarding the need for IFA tablets during pregnancy and the state of IFA supplementation programmes.

To detect a 30% reduction in preterm delivery from 15% in control compared to 10.5% in the intervention arm, assuming 80% power, 5% level of significance, intracluster correlation of 0.012 for small birth size (Bangladesh DHS data), would require a sample size of 1300/arm or 40 pregnant women from 64 clusters. A smaller sample size of 570 women/arm or 40 pregnant women from 28 clusters is needed to detect a 30% reduction in LBW with the same assumptions. Our cluster is one BRAC PO area that consists of ~â13,000 people. Assuming a crude birth rate of 23 per 1000 people, 10% loss of pregnancies before birth and 15% loss to follow up each cluster will yield 300 births over 15Â months, and this will be sufficient to reach the desired sample size.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>22771</offset><text>Recruitment and consent of women</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>22804</offset><text>In the intervention clusters, SSs will make systematic door-to-door visits to identify new pregnancies through menstrual cycle tracking of all women of reproductive age.

In resource-poor countries, rates of maternal anaemia remain high. Although the importance of IFA supplements to prevent maternal anaemia and mortality is widely accepted, most antenatal IFA supplements distribution programs are of low priority. Evaluations of these programs using maternal anaemia as the outcome report little or no impact because of the multiple causes of maternal anaemia, low compliance, and inadequate distribution programs.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32812</offset><text>Recent surveys in Bangladesh indicate that only 52% of rural women reported any use of IFA supplements in their last pregnancy, but this falls to 39% for the poorest households, and to 34% for women with no education. In the Projahnmo trial conducted in rural Bangladesh, only 40% of women in the baseline surveys reported any use of IFA supplements in pregnancy. Access to IFA supplements is through antenatal care, however, in rural Bangladesh, the median gestation that women commence antenatal care is 5.2Â months, and 44% of women report no use of antenatal care. The Projahnmo trial demonstrated improved IFA supplements as 84% of pregnant women in the home-care treatment arm reported IFA supplements use in pregnancy. Although they did not start early, these figures indicate there is a substantial opportunity to improve IFA supplements distribution in rural Bangladesh.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33692</offset><text>There is limited evidence about the optimal timing of IFA supplementation in pregnancy. Promising evidence came from a trial in China investigating the effects of IFA supplements in pregnancy on neonatal deaths. However, the neonatal mortality analyses were post-hoc analyses, and the sample size was small resulting in poor precision in the effect estimates, and reduced power to explore all the factors modifying the effects on neonatal mortality.
