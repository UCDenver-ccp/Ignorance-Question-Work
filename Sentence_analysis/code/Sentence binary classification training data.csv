"Headliners: Maternal Nutrition and Child Cancer: Motherâ€™s Pre-pregnancy Diet May Influence Child Cancer Risk\nJensen CD, Block G, Buffler P, Ma X, Selvin S, Month S. 2004.",0
New findings from the NIEHS-funded Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study (NCCLS) show that the disease may originate even earlierâ€”in the foods a woman eats before she even becomes pregnant.,0
"The effect of maternal diet on child leukemia risk has not been rigorously studied; the few studies that have been done have focused on specific dietary factors, and the results have been mixed.",0
It is the first study to capture mothersâ€™ overall dietary patterns and relate them to child leukemia.,0
"Of the vegetables and fruits, carrots and cantaloupe showed the highest inverse effect, perhaps because of these foodsâ€™ high carotenoid content.",0
String beans and peas also correlated inversely with ALL risk.,0
"The authors stress that dietary factors work together, and no one food should be singled out in attributing risk or benefit.",0
"Further, a cause-and-effect relationship can not be concluded from this study.",0
"However, they write, it remains prudent for women who are pregnant or think they may become pregnant to eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables.",0
Recent research has confirmed that ALL can originate in utero .,0
"Among the proteins, beef and beansâ€”both sources of the antioxidant glutathioneâ€”showed the highest inverse effect.",0
Lesions of testis and epididymis associated with prenatal diethylstilbestrol exposure.,0
Results from an international case-control study of childhood brain tumors: the role of prenatal vitamin supplementation.,0
"These findings are largely driven by data from the United States, where most mothers took vitamins.",0
"Mothers also took individual micronutrient supplements (e.g., vitamin C tablets), but most mothers who took these also took multivitamins, making it impossible to determine potential independent effects of these micronutrients.",0
"Although risk estimates varied by study center, combined results suggest that maternal supplementation for two trimesters may decrease risk of brain tumor (odds ratio [OR] 0.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.5-0.9), with a trend of less risk with longer duration of use (p trend = 0.0007).",0
"Pregnant women are famously exhorted to faithfully take their daily prenatal vitamins, which often contain iron and other minerals.",0
"None of the women were anemic at that point, but 66% had low levels of ferritin (the principal form of stored iron), suggesting low iron nutritional status.",0
"Ironically, both early gestational iron-deficiency anemia and hemoconcentration later in pregnancy increase the risk of premature birth and low birth weight.",0
"Thus, the researchers suggest that excess iron supplementation can cause the same problems it is supposed to correct.",0
"Animal studies suggest that excess iron can also trigger formation of free radicals in the intestinal mucosa and other tissues, and that both iron deficiency and iron overload can damage nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA.",0
This kind of damage has been implicated in cancer induction.,0
"The intestinal mucosa is renewed every 5 to 6 days and will absorb as much iron as necessary to maintain iron balance; however, mature cells will stop absorbing iron entirely if they are flooded with it, even if there is an iron deficit.",0
"A more subtly calibrated iron supplementation during pregnancy may be as effective as current public health recommendations, and perhaps safer.",0
But new research suggests that a weekly iron supplement coinciding with the renewal of the small intestineâ€™s mucosal lining cells (where nutrient absorption occurs) works better than a daily supplement and prevents problems resulting from too much iron at the wrong times.,0
Reproductive Toxicity: Too Much of a Good Thing?,0
The main aim was to study factors identified in a previous study as potentially causally related to cancer of the oesophagus.,0
"The use of opium, bread and tea could not be assessed in the retrospective framework.",0
Strongly associated with risk of oesophageal cancer were low socio-economic status and low intake of fresh fruit and vegetables.,0
"Other tumours (lung, stomach, breast, large bowel, larynx and pharynx) were included to distinguish findings specific for oesophageal cancer from general characteristics of cancer patients, due for example to ascertainment bias, and to verify that expected associations, such as between lung cancer and cigarette smoking, would emerge under the prevailing field conditions.",0
"In the February 2008 issue of Food and Chemical Toxicology , researchers from India report that aqueous garlic extract (AGE) fed to at-risk individuals may reduce the toxic effects of arsenic.",0
"Moreover, previously noted associations between current smoking and age at menopause were not observed among these women.",0
"These birds, which lived in northeastern Siberia, northern Alaska, and northern Greenland, are believed to have had no contact with humans.",0
"The researchers proposed three possible explanations for their findings: the birds could have been exposed to the bacteria through contact with other species of birds migrating from other regions, or resistance could have developed either through spontaneous mutations or through horizontal gene transfer from other microbes.",0
"This rule, the first of its kind in the world, will apply mainly to personal care products but also could apply to other categories such as food and textiles.",0
The group cites insufficient evidence on the impact of nanomaterials on the environment and human health.,0
"China Begins National Survey of Pollution Sources\nAlthough China has set goals to cut emissions of major pollutants, emissions of sulfur dioxide and some indicators of poor water quality increased in 2006.",0

Ancient Chinese Cancer Secret?,0
"In the clinical trials, compounds from the venom have proven beneficial and caused no apparent side effects in patients with advanced liver, pancreatic, or lung cancer.",0
"Cardiac glycosides in the venom are thought to inhibit proteins that promote cancer cell growth, thereby causing cancer cell death.",0
"The researchers believe the antioxidant properties of garlic, along with the chelating efficacy exhibited, led to the success of the treatment.",0
"Although potentially toxic at high doses, these glycosides are used to treat congestive heart failure.",0
"Currently, the venom-based treatment is administered by injection, but the Texas researchers hope to develop a pill form.",0
The Beat\n\nSavory Relief for Arsenic Poisoning?,0
In Utero Cigarette Smoke Exposure and Age at Menopause\nIt is well documented that women who smoke cigarettes begin menopause earlier than nonsmokers.,0
Protein Expression in the Nucleus Accumbens of Rats Exposed to Developmental Vitamin D Deficiency\n\nAbstract\n\nIntroduction\nDevelopmental vitamin D (DVD) deficiency is a candidate risk factor for schizophrenia.,0
"Because the nucleus accumbens has been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, in the current study we examined protein expression in this region in adult rats exposed to DVD deficiency\n\nMethods\nFemale Sprague Dawley rats were maintained on a vitamin D deficient diet for 6 weeks, mated and allowed to give birth, after which a diet containing vitamin D was reintroduced.",0
"Based on a False Discovery Rate of 28%, we predict that nine of these spots would be false positives.10.1371/journal.pone.0002383.g001\n\nCaption (FIG): FIGURE 1\nAltered proteins in the nucleus accumbens in adult DVD-deficient and control male rats.",0
"Several of the components of the network converge on MAPK1, a MAP kinase that serves to integrate multiple biochemical signals (previously known as ERK2), that was found to be significantly down-regulated in the proteomics study.10.1371/journal.pone.0002383.g002\n\nCaption (FIG): FIGURE 2\nNetwork analysis of the proteins assembled by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.",0
"Discussion\nDevelopmental vitamin D deficiency is associated with a subtle alteration in the expression of protein involved in functions related to calcium binding proteins, and mitochondrial functioning.",0
Compromised calcium buffering in the nucleus accumbens could disrupt adaptive and goal-directed behaviors.,0
"The small fold changes found in the study, while statistically significant, were too low to be reliably confirmed via immunoblot[49].",0
"Calcium binding proteins have been of interest to schizophrenia research for some time[27], in particular with respect to the expression in cortical GABAergic interneurons[28].",0
"Calcium binding proteins are central to a wide range of cellular functions, of which calcium sequestration and buffering are particularly important for neurons.",0
"Amongst other functions, it is thought that this family of diffuse cytoplasmic proteins provides a â€˜sinkâ€™ allowing cells to rapidly buffer intracellular calcium after actions potentials, thus allowing the cell to rapidly repolarise for further firing.",0
"Other proteins associated with DVD deficiency related to mitochondrial function, and the dynamin-like proteins.",0
"Calbindin is strongly induced by vitamin D[29], and thus it is feasible that the reduction in this protein may be a consequence of the early life reduction in vitamin D. The potential links between vitamin D and neuronal calcium binding proteins has been noted in a recent review article[30]\nTwo members of the dynamin family (dynamin 1 and dynamin 1-like proteins) were also significantly down-regulated.",0
"These proteins are essential for clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a role of particular importance in neurons for neurotransmitter release[31].",0
"Apart from this function, these proteins are essential for the insertion of dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2) into the nonsynaptic membrane of dopaminergic neurons[32].",0
These findings suggest that proteins involved in SNAP and SNARE mediated vesicle release may be disrupted in the DVD model.,0
These findings suggest that cellular energics may be altered in this brain region in the DVD-deficient rat.,0
"Curiously, it has recently been shown that dynamin 1-like protein is also important for mitochondrial fission and general morphology[33].",0
"It is known that down-regulation of calcium binding proteins shift essential calcium buffering requirements to the mitochondrial compartment, which, in turn, leads to compromised mitochondrial energy production[34].",0
Conclusions\nDevelopmental vitamin D deficiency was associated with subtle changes in protein expression in the nucleus accumbens.,0
"With respect to the nucleus accumbens, calcium-binding proteins such as calbindin are often used to demarcate discrete neuroanatomical boundaries, inferring that these proteins confer selective functional properties to these cells[35].",0
"In the core region of the nucleus accumbens, neurons have dense spines, which may reflect the degree of synaptic plasticity required for the integrative function of cells in this region[36].",0
"Many of the dopaminergic cells in this region also express neuropeptides such as bradykinan, neurotensin and substance P. The protein with the greatest fold change in this study was thimet oligopeptidase (down-regulated 1.67), which is involved in the degradation of these small proteins[37].",0
Neuropeptides such as neurotensin can indirectly influence dopaminergic transmission in the nucleus accumbens via glutamate and GABA-ergic mediated processes[38].,0
"Thus, these neuropeptides are of interest as potential targets for novel antipsychotic agents[39],[40].",0
"Disruptions in pathways related to calcium-binding proteins and mitochondrial function may underlie some of the behavioural features associated with animal models of developmental vitamin D deficiency\n\nIntroduction\nBased on clues from epidemiology, we have proposed that low prenatal vitamin D may be a risk factor for later development of schizophrenia[1].",0
"Curiously, it has been shown that calcium concentration is an important modulator of thimet oligopeptidase activity[41], thus the disruption of this protein may also be down-stream consequence of altered calcium buffering.",0
"With respect to schizophrenia, several of proteins identified in this study have also been reported to be disrupted in post-mortem brain tissue from patients with schizophrenia.",0
"A range of studies (proteomics, genomics, gene association studies) have linked schizophrenia with alterations in malate dehydrogenase cytoplasmic (MDHC, now known as malic enzyme 2)[42]â€“[47].",0
"Similarly, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1, significantly down-regulated in this study, has been found to be down-regulated at both the mRNA and protein levels in post-mortem schizophrenia brain tissue (thalamus)[48]\nLike the previous proteomic study[18], we found no alterations in proteins directly associated with DA signaling.",0
This suggests that baseline DA signaling may be normal in this model and abnormalities only become unmasked in the presence of drugs that alter DA/glutamate balance in the brain.,0
It is conceivable that a slight reduction in calcium buffering proteins may affect the ability of neurons within the nucleus accumbens to repolarise in response to psychomimetic agents.,0
"Alternately, any reduction in cellular energetics within this region may delay the integration of cortical and/or sub-cortical inputs.",0
"Disappointingly, we found no overlap with the proteins identified in the current study versus those in the previous publication[18].",0
"However, the previous study was based on cortical and hippocampal tissue from adult female animals, whereas the current study was based on tissue from the nucleus accumbens in adult male animals.",0
Interpretation of the current study is also limited because of the lack of immunoblot confirmation of the differentially expressed spots.,0
"Based on the behavioural findings in DVD-deficient rats, there is a case to explore proteomic dysregulation in rats after exposure to drugs known to disrupt dopaminergic and glutaminergic pathways.",0
"For example, we have shown that while habituated DVD rats have normal locomotion activity in the open field at baseline, they have pronounced hyperlocomotion after exposure to MK-801[10],[12].",0
We plan to explore these issues in future experiments.,0
"In conclusion, developmental vitamin D deficiency is associated with subtle changes in a range of proteins in the nucleus accumbens.",0
These findings suggest that pathways involved in calcium binding and mitochondrial function may underpin the behavioural features associated with this particular animal model of schizophrenia.,0
"Combined with other experimental findings, the current study lends further credibility to the notion that developmental vitamin D deficiency impacts adversely on normal brain development[30].",0
"Many studies have shown that those born in winter and spring have a significantly increased risk of developing schizophrenia[2], and that those born at higher latitudes are also at increased risk of schizophrenia[3].",0
"Animal models have confirmed that DVD deficiency is associated with a range of altered genomic, proteomic, structural and behavioural outcomes in the rat.",0
"Given that vitamin D levels in the population fluctuate across the seasons and decrease across higher latitude[4], low prenatal vitamin D â€˜fitsâ€™ these key environmental features and is therefore a plausible candidate risk factor for this disease.",0
"In order to explore the biological plausibility of this candidate, we have a rat model that we call the Developmental Vitamin D (DVD) model.",0
Rats exposed to low prenatal vitamin D have a broad range of neurobiological outcomes that are informative for schizophrenia research.,0
5) DVD-deficient rats also have altered attentional processing indicated by impaired latent inhibition[11].,0
Some of the most robust and consistent findings in the DVD model have emerged in behavioural pharmacological studies.,0
"For example, we have shown that DVD-deficient rats have enhanced locomotion in response to the psychomimetic agents such as NMDA antagonist MK-801[10],[12].",0
Dysfunction of DA signalling has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia[13].,0
"Dopamine projections involve a range of cortical and subcortical regions, however its role in the nucleus accumbens has been of particular interest with respect to neuropsychiatric disorders[14]â€“[16].",0
"In the nucleus accumbens, dopamine influences the integration of inputs from the ventral hippocampus, the amygdala, and the prefrontal cortex.",0
Grace and colleagues have suggested that dopamine may modulate a range of limbic and cortical functions relevant to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia via the nucleus accumbens[17].,0
"Previously we explored the genomic and proteomic characteristics of frontal cortex and the hippocampus in the adult DVD rat[18],[19].",0
"These proteins are associated with several biological pathways including oxidative phosphorylation, cytoskeleton maintenance, calcium homeostasis, chaperoning, synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission.",0
A computational analysis of these data revealed that many of the proteins dysregulated in the DVD model have also been shown to be altered in schizophrenia post-mortem brain studies[18].,0
"In order to further explore the impact of DVD on brain function, we undertook a proteomic study of the nucleus accumbens.",0
"Female rats were not used in these experiments, because the estrous cycle can introduce variability in protein expression in the region of interest[20],[21].",0
"Generally, a peptide match with at least 30% total sequence coverage was required for confidence in identification, but very low and high mass protein, and those resulting from protein fragmentation may not always meet the criterion.",0
"Although many proteins were found to be significantly altered in DVD-deficient adults, the fold-change level was insufficient for confirmation analysis by western blot.",0
"Finally, proteomic analyses are prone to Type I errors.",0
"While we did not adjust the p value for the number of comparisons undertaken, we report the false discovery rate, which provides an estimate of the proportion of significantly different proteins (p<0.05) that may be truly null[25],[26].",0
"In previous work and a scoping study, we found that most of the research carried out in relation to impaired spermatogenesis had investigated time trends rather than association with specific risk factors (Martin et al.",0
"Further, our analysis was limited to prenatal exposure to estrogenic agents.",0
A number of studies have found associations between sperm motility or sperm DNA damage with levels of estrogenic chemicals measured either in urine or serum (Duty et al.,0
Respond\nIn response to Prasadâ€™s constructive comments on our quantitative meta-analysis of the estrogen hypothesis and testicular dysgenesis syndrome (Martin et al.,0
It would not be possible however to relate such levels to prenatal exposure.,0
This also illustrates the difficulty of selecting a suitable marker of impaired spermatotogenesis.,0
Our study was implicitly limited to congenital cryptorchidism because the literature search did not yield any caseâ€“control or cohort studies that addressed the question of prenatal exposure to estrogenic compounds and acquired cryptorchidism in humans.,0
"We concluded that the significant association between prenatal diethylstilbestrol exposure and all three end points considered conferred weight to the hypothesis of a common etiology for these disorders, and therefore to the existence of a testicular dysgenesis syndrome (Martin et al.",0
"Separate analyses were carried out for the three end points but the methodology applied did not allow us to explore the specific nature of causal relationships between congenital cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and testicular cancer.",0
"2008), we offer the following observations regarding the scope of our study and limitations of the methodology applied.",0
"It cannot, however, correct for potential bias and confounding of the studies included; we addressed this issue in our review (Martin et al.",0
"As gestational diabetes is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, and has long-term implications for both mother and child, it is important that it is recognized and appropriately managed.",0
"This review will examine the pharmacological options for the management of gestational diabetes, as well as the evidence for blood glucose monitoring, dietary and exercise therapy.",0
"Amongst sibships discordant for exposure to hyperglycemia, the sibling exposed to hyperglycemia had a considerably higher risk of subsequent diabetes, suggesting that genetic factors were not predominantly responsible for the difference in diabetes incidence.",0
"Since then, numerous other observational studies have shown that the offspring of diabetic pregnancies have a higher risk of developing a diabetes phenotype.18,19There is also concern that this leads to an intergenerational effect, with GDM promoting diabetes in the offspring, with perpetuation of the vicious cycle when the offspring herself develops GDM, thereby predisposing the grandchild to the development of diabetes as well.20It is unknown however, what degree of hyperglycemia, or indeed if it is related metabolic disturbances, which increases the risk of diabetes to the offspring.",0
"The medical management of gestational diabetes is still evolving, and recent randomized controlled trials have added considerably to our knowledge in this area.",0
Evidence from more contemporary populations is that the likelihood of subsequent diabetes may be substantially higher.22Women who have had GDM account for a significant burden of the population prevalence of diabetes.,0
"It has been estimated that up to one third of women with diabetes, had a GDM pregnancy earlier in their life,2though this was not evident in a recent survey of women with type 2 diabetes.23\nThis review will focus on the medical management of GDM, in particular self monitoring of blood glucose and diabetes education, dietary therapy and physical activity, pharmacotherapy, and post-partum management.",0
"For an excellent discussion of the obstetric management of GDM, I will refer the reader to the review by Conway.24\n\nDiabetes education, self-monitoring of blood glucose, dietary therapy, and exercise\nSelf-care is an important component of the management of GDM.",0
The involvement of a dietician and diabetes educator experienced in the care of women with GDM will facilitate these areas of management.,0
Blood glucose monitoring\nWomen with GDM should perform home blood glucose monitoring.,0
Treatment to post-prandial targets results in superior pregnancy outcomes compared to pre-prandial targets.25The recommended treatment targets vary from country to country (Table 2).,0
These are largely consensus-based as the risk of complications is continuous and there are no obvious thresholds above which the risk markedly increases.,0
"As insulin therapy is effective and safe, it is considered the gold standard of pharmacotherapy for gestational diabetes, against which other treatments have been compared.",0
Lifestyle measures can provide adequate control in the majority of cases.,0
"If glucose targets are not adequately met by lifestyle measures, and perhaps a review of dietary intake, then pharmacotherapy should be introduced.",0
"Rather than basing the need for insulin on glycemic parameters alone, some have advocated the combined use of ultrasound assessment of fetal abdominal circumference in combination with blood glucose levels.",0
Dietary therapy\nIt is generally accepted that dietary therapy is the cornerstone of treatment of GDM.,0
Therefore all women with GDM should receive counseling from a specialist dietitian.,0
The aim is to achieve normoglycemia whilst providing the required nutrients for normal fetal growth and maternal health.,0
"There are few trials examining the efficacy of dietary therapy for GDM, However, a cluster randomized controlled study has provided support for Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) for GDM, as recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) (2004).",0
"In this study, 215 women with GDM were seen at sites randomized to deliver either MNT or standard care.27Fewer subjects in the MNT group required insulin (24.6% vs 31.7%, p = 0.05) and there was a trend to fewer women having a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) >6% (8.1% vs 13.6%, p = 0.25).",0
"The ADA states that all women should receive individualized counseling to provide adequate calories and nutrients to meet the needs of pregnancy and consistent with the blood glucose goals (fasting â‰¤105 mg/dl [5.8 mmol/L], 1 hr â‰¤155 mg/dl [8.6 mmol/L], and 2 hrs â‰¤130 mg/dl [7.2 mmol/L]).",0
"The current experience is that the short acting insulin analogs lispro and aspart are safe, but there are only limited data to support the use of long acting insulin analogs.",0
"Although there was an initial small uncontrolled report which suggested that Lispro may have teratogenic effects when used in type 1 diabetic pregnancy,37this has not been borne out in subsequent studies.",0
There are a number of case reports and small case series of glargine being utilized without the development of pregnancy complications.,0
"There are also data from a total of 48 women with GDM.46,47To date no randomized controlled studies have been published.",0
None of these events were adjudged by the data and safety monitoring committee to be treatment related and there were no serious adverse events associated with the use of metformin.,0
There are no studies using glitazones in pregnancy.,0
"Transplacental transfer occurs,67,81and until studies demonstrating safety are performed, they should be avoided in pregnancy.",0
"These studies were largely retrospective, unrandomized, or lacked power to detect differences in serious adverse perinatal outcomes and will not be listed here.",0
"For obese women, a 30%â€“33% calorie restriction to approximately 25 kcal/kg actual weight per day is recommended.",0
Carbohydrate should be restricted to 35%â€“40% of calories.,0
"There are also data to support low carbohydrate diets in pregnancy, and for the carbohydrate to be of low glycemic index.",0
"In a nonrandomized study, women with GDM on a diet comprising less than 42% carbohydrate, had lower post-prandial glucose levels, were less likely to require insulin, and had a lower incidence of large for gestational age.28A small study which randomized pregnant women to low glycemic index (GI) or high GI diets found that the former resulted in lower glucose levels, a blunting of the pregnancy associated rise in insulin resistance, and lower birthweight.29In another study of GI, women assigned to a low GI diet during pregnancy gave birth to infants who were lighter (3408 Â± 78 g vs 3644 Â± 90 g) and had a lower incidence of large for gestational age, compared to women given a high GI diet.30Both diets comprised 55% carbohydrate.",0
"Whilst the latter studies were not specifically performed in women with GDM, they suggest that the concept of GI is valid in pregnancy, and it would be appropriate to recommend low GI carbohydrate to women with GDM.",0
Additional dietary measures are usually based upon the general recommendations for diabetes mellitus.,0
A reduction in simple carbohydrates and fat intake is advisable.,0
"Emphasis is given to spreading the dietary intake over six meals daily, with three main meals and three snacks, in order to avoid large carbohydrate loads at any time.",0
"Except for saccharin, which can cross the placenta and is therefore not recommended, other noncaloric sweeteners may be used in moderation.",0
"Physical activity\nIn people with type 2 diabetes, there is ample evidence that regular physical activity enhances insulin sensitivity, facilitates weight loss, and thereby improves glucose control.",0
"Several small studies have examined whether regular exercise is also beneficial in the management of GDM Jovanavic-Petersen randomized 19 women with GDM to a regime of diet alone, or diet with 20 minutes of supervised aerobic training three days per week for six weeks.31This modest amount of physical activity resulted in lower fasting glucose levels, lower glucose responses to a glucose challenge, and a lower HbA1c.",0
"Another study randomized 29 women with GDM to 30 minutes of exercise at 70% estimated maximal heart rate, 3â€“4 times per week, or control.32There was a trend to improved glucose levels in those who exercised, which did not reach significance.",0
"Measures of cardiorespiratory fitness however, improved.",0
There are randomized controlled trials which have demonstrated efficacy of the oral agents glyburide and metformin.,0
"A study of 32 women randomized to circuit type exercise three times a week or control, found that resistance training resulted in lower postprandial glucose levels, and a delay in the requirement of insulin.33Amongst women with a prepregnancy BMI > 25, those who were in the exercise arm were less likely to require insulin.",0
"Therefore, it seems reasonable to recommend that when there is no medical or obstetric contraindication, women with GDM should maintain a sensible level of light and moderate intensity physical activity until the latter stages of the pregnancy.",0
"The above studies provide reassurance that moderate intensity activities such as walking for 20â€“30 minutes each day, and attendance at antenatal exercise classes can be safely encouraged, and that modest improvements in glycemic control might be achieved.",0
"Whilst short-term data have not demonstrated adverse effects of glyburide and metformin on the fetus, and they are increasingly being used in pregnancy, there remain long-term concerns regarding their potential for harm.",0
"Insulin therapy for gestational diabetes\nWhen treatment targets are not achieved by dietary means, then insulin is required.",0
"In some cases, an additional morning injection of basal insulin may further improve glycemic control.",0
"As the level of insulin resistance varies from person to person, it is common practice to commence the woman on small doses of insulin, and then to increase the doses at frequent intervals until target glucose levels are attained.",0
The required dosage of insulin usually increases gradually over the third trimester of pregnancy.,0
This may be an early indicator of placental insufficiency.,0
Frequent review and titration of the insulin dosage is recommended.,0
"Unlike the situation for women with pre-existing type 1 diabetes however, significant hypoglycemia is uncommon in women with insulin-treated GDM.",0
Nonetheless the woman should be advised regarding appropriate hypoglycemia prevention and management measures.,0
"For many years, fast-acting (regular) insulin, and intermediate-acting (isophane) insulin have been the preferred insulins for the treatment of GDM.",0
"Human insulin does not normally cross the placenta, though antibody bound animal insulin has been reported to do so.35However, it has been shown by36Jovanovic that it is maternal glucose control, rather than maternal anti-insulin antibody levels which influence birthweight.36Human insulin is considered safe in pregnancy as years of experience has not suggested an increase in fetal complications as a consequence of its use.",0
"There is now increasing evidence that the newer rapid acting insulin analogs lispro and aspart are also safe in pregnancy, and indeed, they are commonly used.",0
"No increase in pregnancy complications have been found in observational studies where lispro was used, in either women with GDM38,43or pre-existing diabetes.38â€“43There are few reports regarding the use of aspart in pregnancy.",0
"However, a large randomized controlled trial comparing aspart with regular human insulin in 322 pregnant women with type 1 diabetes has been performed.44Comparable birth outcomes were found between the two arms, suggesting that aspart is as safe and effective as human insulin.",0
"Background\nGestational diabetes (GDM) is defined as â€œcarbohydrate intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancyâ€.1Large studies have found that GDM occurs in 2.2%â€“8.8% of pregnancies, depending on the ethnic mix of the population and the criteria used for diagnosis.2In some specific populations however, the incidence can be considerably higher.",0
"They have all demonstrated that the rapid acting analogues are as effective as regular insulin in the treatment of GDM, with comparable, if not favorable, outcomes (Table 3).",0
"In one study, aspart was detected in the cord blood for one subject.45However, as it was not detected in other subjects, the authors postulated that this was due to the disruption of the uterine-placental barrier during delivery, when the mother had been receiving an aspart infusion.",0
As yet there have been no reports of the use of glulisine in pregnancy.,0
Data regarding the long-acting insulin analogs are less clear than for rapid-acting analogs.,0
The majority of these have been in patients with type 1 diabetes.,0
"Concerns have been expressed about the use of glargine in pregnancy, because of its potential effect on mitogenesis, mediated by its high affinity to the IGF-1 receptor, which is six times that of natural insulin48,49Whilst insulin detemir has a lower binding affinity to the IGF-1 receptor than natural insulin, there is even less information regarding its use in pregnancy.",0
"Although their safety has not been proven, it is often rationalized that a change in the basal insulin will result in deterioration in glycemic control, and therefore the risk of continuing glargine is less than the risk from changing insulins.",0
"However, until their safety in pregnancy can be clearly established, the initiation of long-acting insulin analog therapy in women with GDM cannot be recommended.",0
Oral antidiabetic agents in gestational diabetes\nThere is controversy regarding the use of oral hypoglycemic agents during pregnancy.,0
"Most government drug agencies have not approved their use in pregnancy, and major specialty diabetes organizations recommend that oral agents be ceased if the woman had been taking them pre-pregnancy53â€“55There have now however, been randomized trials conducted with both glyburide and metformin which have not demonstrated short term harm to the pregnancy.",0
"Glyburide (Glibenclamide)\nAmerican authors have stated that glyburide has replaced insulin as first line pharmacological treatment of GDM in many practices.56This has largely occurred on the basis of a randomized controlled trial where 404 women with GDM were treated with glyburide (up to 20 mg/day) or insulin57In this study, the level of glycemic control achieved was the same in both groups (mean glucose concentration during treatment with glyburide 5.9 Â± 0.9 mmol/L compared to 5.9 Â± 1.0 mmol/L in insulin group).",0
Only 4% of women treated with glyburide achieved inadequate control and required a switch to insulin.,0
"Additionally, a number of nonrandomized or retrospective studies examining the treatment of GDM with glyburide have been reported (Table 4).",0
"In general, these indicate that glyburide is effective in achieving glycemic control in the majority of patients.",0
"Most, but not all, suggest that glyburide is as safe as insulin for the fetus.",0
"A meta-analysis which included the above studies as well as others examining women with pre-existing diabetes, with 745 glyburide exposed pregnancies and 637 treated with insulin, has been performed.65This study found that glyburide did not increase the risk of macrosomia, large for gestational age, or neonatal hypoglycemia, but did not examine more serious consequences such as perinatal mortality or congenital anomalies.",0
"Essentially, women at risk of type 2 diabetes are at risk of GDM.",0
Several studies have examined factors which predict failure of glyburide to achieve adequate glycemic control.,0
"Higher glucose levels, either in the glucose tolerance test upon which GDM was diagnosed, or on self-monitoring, and early dietary failure have been found to be associated with glyburide failure.60,58These findings lead to the logical conclusion that subjects with more severe GDM are more likely to require insulin.",0
"Further evidence supporting the safety of glyburide for the fetus comes from a study using an in vitro perfusion, where it was not found to cross the placenta in significant amounts.66However, another in vitro study has found transplacental transfer of glyburide.67In the Langer randomized controlled trial, glyburide was not detected in the cord blood of the neonates and cord insulin levels were similar between the two groups.57\n\nMetformin\nA number of studies have provided conflicting information regarding the safety of metformin use in type 2 diabetic pregnancy.68â€“70There are studies which have used metformin during pregnancy in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, without any noticeable adverse effects on the fetus.71There are few publications of its use in GDM, and these are dominated by the Metformin in Gestational Diabetes (MiG) Study.",0
"The key factor which results in the development of gestational diabetes appears to be a failure to compensate with increased insulin secretion.3As the increase in insulin resistance is greatest in the third trimester, GDM usually develops going into this period.",0
"Interestingly fetal death and malformations were not a component of the primary outcome; however, 19 events in the metformin group were classified as serious fetal or neonatal adverse events (including 11 congenital anomalies) compared to 23 events in the insulin arm (including 18 congenital anomalies and one fetal death).",0
"Additionally, more women using metformin indicated that their treatment was acceptable compared to those on insulin.",0
"From these results, the authors have suggested that metformin is a safe and effective treatment for GDM.",0
Several small studies comparing metformin to insulin for the treatment of GDM have also been performed (Table 5).,0
"Two have concluded that metformin is as effective as insulin for glycemic control in GDM, and that it is safe.",0
"However, one study, a randomised controlled trial, was underpowered to realistically address the effectiveness and safety of metformin in GDM.73In another study, a retrospective case control study, subjects treated with insulin had a greater degree of initial glucose intolerance, so the comparison was of limited validity.74A third study comprised a retrospective cohort which included a mixture of both GDM and women with Type 2 diabetes seen from 1966â€“1991.",0
"It found an increase in stillbirth and perinatal mortality, as well as pre-eclampsia amongst those treated with metformin, compared to women treated with insulin or sulphonylureas.",0
"However, as there was no evaluation of glycemic control early in pregnancy, and more women on metformin had pre-existing type 2 diabetes, the groups do not appear to be well matched.",0
It is quite possible that the adverse findings in this study are due to more women in the metformin group having a greater severity of hyperglycemia early in the pregnancy.,0
"Long-term concerns regarding glyburide and metformin therapy for GDM\nAlthough the above randomized trials have demonstrated non-inferiority of glyburide and metformin in achieving glycemic control, and satisfactory birth outcomes compared to insulin therapy, concerns must remain as long-term issues have not yet been addressed.",0
"Therefore, screening for GDM usually occurs around 24â€“28 weeks into the pregnancy.",0
"Repeated episodes of GDM are associated with the earlier development of diabetes, and this has been postulated to be due to the increased stress that the Î²-cells are exposed to with each pregnancy.75By treating the mother with glyburide, it is possible that this accentuates Î²-cell stress and accelerates their decline, whereas insulin therapy would conversely provide a degree of relief to the Î²-cells.",0
"Therefore glyburide has the potential to result in earlier development of maternal diabetes, and long-term follow-up of the mothers are needed to alleviate this concern.",0
"In contradistinction, metformin reduces insulin resistance and hepatic gluconeogenesis, which theoretically would be beneficial for the preservation of Î²-cell function.",0
"In subjects with type 2 diabetes, the ADOPT Study has demonstrated that metformin is superior to glyburide in this regard.76As there is transplacental passage of metformin,77,78its effect on fetal insulin resistance might even provide further benefit in light of data of insulin resistance and insulin secretory defects in offspring of diabetic pregnancies.19However, any pharmacological agent which crosses the placenta must be viewed with caution as there always remains the possibility of unexpected long-term effects.",0
"The diagnosis is made with an oral glucose tolerance test, though the criteria vary around the world (Table 1).",0
Metformin alters gene expression in mice livers and has been demonstrated to have an antiproliferative effect through reductions in cyclin D1 and activation of AMP kinase.79The programming and developmental effects of these on a fetus are unknown.,0
"Furthermore, metformin can promote the development of lactic acidosis, which surely must be a concern in situations of fetal distress.",0
"Whilst 18-month follow-up data on 126 offspring of women with polycystic ovary syndrome treated with metformin during pregnancy have not revealed any deficiencies in growth or motor-social development, this may be too short a time frame for potential programming effects of metformin to become evident.80\nIn view of the above concerns regarding the potential of glyburide and metformin to have long-term effects on the mother and child, I would recommend caution with their use in the treatment of GDM.",0
"Risk factors for the development of GDM include obesity, older age, family history, previous history of GDM or poor obstetric outcomes, ethnicity, polycystic ovary syndrome and as more recently noted, hypertension.4,5\nThe major significance of GDM is that it is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.",0
A subgroup of infants from the MIG Study are currently being followed up.72It may be circumspect to await the findings from this follow-up study before metformin can be considered safe for the routine treatment of GDM.,0
"Other oral antidiabetic agents for gestational diabetes\nThere is one study which randomized women with GDM to treatment with insulin, glyburide, or acarbose.61Forty two percent of the acarbose subjects failed to achieve adequate glycemic control and ultimately required insulin therapy.",0
"Whilst this study is inadequately powered to demonstrate safety of acarbose, it is not absorbed from the gut, and therefore would be unlikely to affect the fetus.",0
However it is of low potency and insulin therapy will often need to be introduced.,0
"Furthermore, the high frequency of gastrointestinal side effects experienced by people with type 2 diabetes suggests that any future role of acarbose, even if subsequent studies confirm safety, will be limited.",0
"Evidence that treatment of gestational diabetes improves pregnancy outcomes\nThe strongest evidence that treatment of GDM is of benefit comes from the Australian Carbohydrate Intolerance Study (ACHOIS) in Pregnant Women.82In this randomized controlled trial, 1000 women fulfilling the 1985 WHO criteria for â€œgestational glucose intoleranceâ€ were recruited.",0
One other important finding of this study was that intensively treated women had better quality of life and lower rates of depression.,0
"Prior to ACHOIS, a large number of other studies had been performed to ascertain if treatment of GDM is of benefit.",0
"However, one large retrospective cohort study of 116,303 pregnancies, merits discussion.",0
"It therefore seems likely that the decreased mortality rate was at least in part a consequence of treatment of GDM, rather than only to other improvements in obstetric outcome.",0
Post-partum management of gestational diabetes\nThe medical management of gestational diabetes should not conclude with the delivery of the fetus.,0
"Although hyperglycemia usually resolves with the conclusion of the pregnancy, women who have had GDM are at high risk of developing diabetes later in life.",0
"Apart from the development of diabetes, women who have had GDM have an adverse cardiac risk profile, including the metabolic syndrome.83,84A higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease that occurs at a younger age, independent of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes has also been demonstrated.83\nIn view of the above, it is important that the woman who has had GDM receive counseling and support to reduce her long-term risk of diabetes.",0
"Screening for diabetes, at regular intervals, is recommended by a number of diabetes societies.4,85This is important for the early diagnosis of diabetes, to facilitate the prevention of complications.",0
"Furthermore, if the woman is of reproductive age, the pre-pregnancy recognition of diabetes is vital so that early pregnancy conditions can be optimized to prevent diabetes fetopathy.",0
"Issues specific to pre-existing diabetes in pregnancy include tight glycemic control and adequate folate supplementation.53,54Additionally, post partum evaluation and management of reversible cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, obesity, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia should be undertaken.",0
"There is evidence that lifestyle modification, aiming for a 5%â€“7% reduction in body weight, is effective in preventing or delaying the development of diabetes in people with impaired glucose tolerance.",0
"Both the Diabetes Prevention Program86and the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study87demonstrated this, with an intensive intervention including lifestyle coaches, strict supervised exercise regimes and caloric restriction.",0
"As 15% of the women in the Diabetes Prevention Program and Diabetes Prevention Study had GDM, similar measures should be recommended to women after they have had GDM.",0
"Macrosomia, shoulder dystocia with its attendant risks of brachial plexus injury and clavicle fracture, and neonatal hypoglycemia are the serious complications which most commonly occur.6â€“11Jaundice, polycythemia, respiratory distress, and hypocalcemia have also been reported.",0
"However, it is unclear if less intensive interventions can be effective in this population.",0
"To date, small short-term studies focusing on dietary counseling alone, or a combination of behavioral strategies with weekly exercise classes, have not demonstrated an improvement in glucose tolerance.88,89In part, this is probably due to the real life challenges of maintaining motivation for healthy lifestyle change amongst young women at a time that they are having to deal with young children, return to work, and further education.",0
"Nonetheless, there are undisputed benefits to healthy eating and regular physical activity so these activities should be encouraged.",0
"Summary and conclusions\nGestational diabetes is a common disorder which in the majority of cases, should initially be managed by dietary measures.",0
Moderate physical activity should be encouraged.,0
Fasting and post-prandial glucose testing is necessary for monitoring and guidance of therapy.,0
"Where dietary measures are inadequate to achieve glycemic targets, insulin should be introduced.",0
"Insulin is still the mainstay of pharmacological treatment of GDM, and this is ideally administered in a basal bolus regimen.",0
"The rapid acting analogs lispro and aspart are considered safe, but the safety of the long-acting analogs are yet to be determined.",0
"Whilst there are studies demonstrating short-term safety of glyburide and metformin during pregnancy, I suggest that they be reserved for situations where implementation of insulin therapy is impractical or not possible.",0
"After all, we know that insulin therapy is safe and usually effective.",0
ACHOIS has shown that it is acceptable to the majority of women.,0
"By eschewing insulin, doctors may actually be treating their own perceived fear of injections, rather than providing the best therapy to the patient.",0
"Based on our current information, insulin is still the best option, with the least potential for long-term risk to the mother and child.",0
"With good medical and obstetric care, the risks to the pregnancy should be minimal.",0
"However, a woman with GDM is a woman at high risk of future diabetes.",0
"Therefore after the pregnancy, healthy lifestyle measures should be encouraged to minimize the likelihood of developing diabetes, and regular screening for diabetes should be undertaken.",0
"Additionally, there are some data that suggest an increase in fetal malformation and perinatal mortality.7,12â€“15The above risks can be minimized with good glycemic control and judicious obstetric care.",0
"Cesarean sections are also more common, and GDM is associated with a higher risk of pre-eclampsia.9â€“11\nExposure of the fetus to hyperglycemia may also predispose the child to a diabetes phenotype in later life.",0
"This has been elegantly demonstrated by the long-term follow-up of the offspring of Pima Indian mothers.16,17Offspring who were born to mothers who were already diabetic when pregnant had a 45% likelihood of type 2 diabetes by the age of 20â€“24, whereas it was 8.6% amongst those with mothers who only developed diabetes after pregnancy (ie, were prediabetic).",0
"Early life nutrition, the developing immune system and subsequent allergic manifestations\nOver the last half-century, chronic disease incidence, including allergic manifestations (AM), has increased exponentially in developed nations and amongst the wealthy in developing nations.",0
"Based on an extensive review of the literature, we considered this hypothesis for the 3 nutritional progressions from fetal life through infancy: prenatal nutrition, breastfeeding and introduction of solid foods.",0
"While there is little conclusive evidence to support that a prudent diet is protective against AM especially after birth, modest evidence suggests that a prenatal maternal nutrition high in n-3 and micronutrients (e.g.",0
This indicates that there may be a window of opportunity during fetal development in which allergic manifestation risk may be altered.,0
The effect of breastfeeding on the prevention AM is unresolved.,0
"Despite this, exclusive breastfeeding to 4-6 months should be encouraged as human milk contains numerous immunological properties and is associated with other health benefits.",0
"While diet can impact health at any life stage, it is likely to be most important during the fetal and infancy periods, when the immune system is immature.",0
"If breastfeeding is not possible, hydrolyzed formulas seem to confer a greater protective effect than traditional formulas.",0
Solid foods should be introduced at age 4-6 months.,0
The order of introduction seems to have little effect on AM.,0
"At present, it is impossible to conclusively state that a particular dietary pattern or food will alter AM risk in infants.",0
"Glucose intolerance and gestational diabetes risk in relation to sleep duration and snoring during pregnancy: a pilot study\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nInsufficient sleep and poor sleep quality, considered endemic in modern society, are associated with obesity, impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes.",0
"Little, however, is known about the consequences of insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality during pregnancy on glucose tolerance and gestational diabetes.",0
We evaluated confounding due to several maternal characteristics.,0
We selected potential confounders from a list of variables that were associated with sleep duration and snoring (from prior studies conducted among men and non-pregnant women) and that met criteria for confounding based on a review of the literature and assessment of potential causal relationships based on prior knowledge.,0
"Given that this is the first study to be conducted among pregnant women, and that pre-pregnancy BMI may reasonably be considered a confounder or a covariate along the causal pathway between maternal habitual sleep behaviors and GDM, we were careful to assess the potential independent contributions of the sleep variables (from pre-pregnancy BMI).",0
The distinction is important because adjustment for covariates along the causal pathway may spuriously attenuate estimates of association.,0
We also reported results after stratification so that we (and readers) could assess associations (even with a fair amount of statistical imprecision) without an over-reliance on model-based assumptions.,0
"In keeping with prior studies that sought to assess the extent to which adiposity modified associations between sleep disorders and abnormal carbohydrate metabolism [1,2,4,5,18], we also evaluated the joint effect of pre-pregnancy overweight status and snoring on GDM risk.",0
"Overall, snoring was associated with a 1.86-fold increased risk of GDM (RR = 1.86; 95% CI 0.88-3.94).",0
"Overall, participants included in this analysis tended to be Caucasian, well-educated, and married.",0
Cases were less likely to be of non-Hispanic White race/ethnicity than non-cases.,0
A curvilinear relation was seen across levels of maternal habitual nightly sleep duration in early pregnancy for maternal mean-1 hour plasma glucose concentration after a 50-gram oral glucose challenge during weeks 24-28 gestation (Figure1).,0
The curvilinear relationship remained evident after participants were stratified on the basis of lean (<25 kg/m2) and overweight (â‰¥25 kg/m2) pre-pregnancy status (Figure2a).,0
"As can be seen in Figure2b, the frequency distribution of women with post-50 gram 1-hour glucose concentration â‰¥ 140 mg/dl (i.e., the threshold for screen positive for glucose intolerance) also had a curvilinear pattern.",0
"Regardless of maternal pre-pregnancy overweight status, both short and long sleep durations were associated with higher frequencies of elevated plasma glucose concentrations (Figure2b).",0
Conclusions\nThese preliminary findings suggest associations of short sleep duration and snoring with glucose intolerance and GDM.,0
"Compared with women who did not snore during pregnancy, the adjusted mean 1-hour glucose concentrations were noted to be 6.4 mg/dl higher among those women who snored during pregnancy (Î² = 6.4 mg/dl, 95% CI 0.32-12.5, p = 0.04).",0
"The positive association remained, though was attenuated somewhat, after further adjustment for maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (RR = 4.18; 95% CI 0.94-18.60).",0
We also noted that associations between short sleep duration and GDM risk were particularly pronounced among overweight women (far right column of Table2).,0
"Given the suggestion of a U-shaped relation between sleep duration and GDM risk (with elevated risks for both short and long sleep duration), and given suggestion of a linear trend in risk of GDM for sleep duration ranging from â‰¤ 4 to 5-8 hours, we modeled the risk of GDM in relation to maternal sleep duration as a continuous variable, restricting the study population to women who reported sleeping <10 hours.",0
"In this subgroup analysis, after adjusting for maternal age and race/ethnicity, a 1-hour increase in nightly sleep was associated with a 15% reduction in GDM risk (RR = 0.85; 95% CI 0.69-1.05); though this association was not statistically significant.",0
"When analyses were restricted to overweight women, we noted that the GDM risk was reduced by 24% for each sleep hour increment (RR = 0.76; 95% CI 0.57-1.00 adjusted for maternal age and race/ethnicity), but again the association was not statistically significant.",0
"Reported sleep duration before pregnancy was highly correlated with sleep duration during pregnancy (Ï = 0.92, p < 0.002).",0
Results were similar when analyses were repeated using maternal nightly sleep duration prior to pregnancy (data not shown).,0
"As can be seen from the bottom panel of Table2, maternal snoring was associated with a statistically non-significant 1.86-fold increased risk of GDM (RR = 1.86; 95% CI 0.88-3.94).",0
An elevated risk remained after adjustment for pre-pregnancy BMI (RR = 1.54; 95% CI 0.71-3.35).,0
The risk of GDM was particularly elevated among overweight women who also reported snoring during pregnancy.,0

Curvilinear relations were observed across nocturnal sleep duration categories.,0
"Though consistent with studies of men and non-pregnant women, larger studies that include objective measures of sleep duration, quality and apnea are needed to obtain more precise estimates of observed associations.",0
"Collectively, the findings from this pilot study provides evidence consistent with the notion that glucose homeostasis in pregnancy is sensitive to maternal habitual short sleep duration and snoring during pregnancy.",0
"To our knowledge, this is the first examination of the relation between plasma glucose concentrations, GDM risk and sleep parameters (i.e., snoring and habitual sleep duration) during pregnancy.",0
"A large literature primarily focused on men and non-pregnant women suggest that sleep loss adversely affects glucose metabolism and increases the risk of type 2 diabetes [4,11,16,32-35].",0
"In their cross sectional study of 740 Canadians (323 men and 417 women), Chaput et al noted that short sleep duration (<7 hours) was associated with prevalent type 2 diabetes (OR = 1.58; 95% CI 1.13-2.31) [33].",0
"Ayas et al, in their study of 70,026 US nurses, followed for 10 years, reported that individuals who slept â‰¤ 5 hours per night had a significantly higher risk of symptomatic incident diabetes (OR = 1.34; 95% CI 1.04-1.72) [4].",0
"Analysis of data from the Massachusetts Male Aging Study revealed that short sleep duration at baseline (â‰¤5 or 6 hours per night) was associated with elevated risk of developing incident type 2 diabetes after adjustment for covariates, including age, hypertension, smoking, self-rated health, waist circumference, education, total testosterone and cortisol [11].",0
"Further, Gangwisch et al, in their analysis of data from the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) noted that individuals reporting â‰¤ 5 hours of sleep (OR = 1.47; 95% CI 1.03-2.09) and those reporting sleeping â‰¥ 9 hours (OR = 1.52; 95% CI 1.06-2.18) had increased risks of developing diabetes as compared to those reporting 7 hours of sleep [34].",0
Our findings of elevated risks of incident GDM among women reporting both long and short sleep durations in early pregnancy are consistent with these earlier reports from men and non pregnant women.,0
"Our observations of impaired post-load glucose tolerance and increased risk of GDM among women who snore during pregnancy are also consistent with a growing body of epidemiological evidence that documents markers of the severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and increased risk of type 2 diabetes in diverse populations of men and non-pregnant women from various geographic regions [32,36-38].",0
"In a cross-sectional study of elderly Danish men and women, investigators noted that self-reported snoring was associated with abnormal glucose tolerance test results after control for confounding factors [36].",0
"These findings were subsequently corroborated and extended by others, including, Al-Delaimy et al [32] who reported that self-reported regular snoring was independently associated with a 2-fold increased risk (RR = 2.03; 95% CI 1.71-2.40) of developing type 2 diabetes over a 10-year follow-up period.",0
"Lindberg et al [37], in their cross sectional study of 6,799 Swedish women, for instance, reported that self-reported snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness was an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes (OR = 1.82; 95% CI 0.97-3.43).",0
"In a population-based Swedish study of 2,668 men followed for 10-years, investigators reported that the multivariable adjusted relative risk for incident type 2 diabetes was highest for obese snorers (OR = 7.0; 95% CI 2.9-16.9) than for lean non-snorers [38].",0
In our study we found that the adjusted relative risk of GDM was highest among overweight mothers who snored during pregnancy (OR = 6.91; 95% CI 2.87-16.3) when compared with lean mothers who did not snore.,0
"In summary, available data support the notion that habitual snoring may be a risk factor for abnormal glucose metabolism.",0
Our finding extends this literature by adding preliminary evidence that links snoring with pregnancy-related impaired glucose tolerance and GDM.,0
"First, our determination of maternal sleep duration and snoring was based on reports made early during pregnancy, so reporting was not conditional on pregnancy outcomes or on signs and symptoms of GDM.",0
Our results suggest that habitual short/long sleep duration and snoring precede the clinical diagnosis of GDM.,0
"Second, the high follow-up rate (>95%) minimized possible selection bias.",0
"However, several limitations merit discussion and consideration.",0
"Maternal habitual sleep duration and snoring was obtained from self-report, and thus are likely susceptible to misclassification.",0
"Reported sleep duration is known to be only moderately correlated with wrist actigraph-measured sleep duration (Ï = 0.47), and reports are generally longer by approximately 34 minutes for each hour of objectively measured sleep [39].",0
Background\nInsufficient sleep duration and poor sleep quality are considered to be endemic in modern society.,0
The use of self-reported snoring as a tool to detect sleep disordered breathing is well established.,0
"Investigators have shown that self-reported snoring correlates well with objective findings from nocturnal polysomnography, especially in frequent snorers [40].",0
Our pilot study was also limited by the relatively small sample of GDM cases (n = 68) and the imprecision of relative risk estimates which were reflected by their wide 95% confidence intervals.,0
"Findings from epidemiological and animal experimental studies indicate that chronic partial sleep loss is associated with increased risks of obesity and a myriad of obesity-related disorders including impaired glucose tolerance, hypertension, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, coronary heart disease, stroke and premature mortality [1-8].",0
"Although qualitative results (i.e., normal/abnormal blood glucose concentrations) for the diagnostic test were available for all 251 subjects, specific glucose concentrations for each time point (i.e., fasting; 1-hour; 2-hour; and 3-hour post glucose load) were unavailable for approximately 44% of subjects.",0
"Lastly, the generalizability of our study may be limited, as our cohort was primarily comprised of Non-Hispanic White and well-educated women.",0
"The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these consistently observed associations of short sleep duration, sleep-related breathing disorders, including snoring, with altered glucose metabolism and diabetes are likely to be multifactorial [2,43,44].",0
"Notably, high sympathetic nervous system activity, intermittent hypoxemia, dysregulation of the HPA axis, endothelial dysfunction and alterations in cytokine and adipokine synthesis and release have all been proposed mechanisms for these consistently observed epidemiological observations.",0
"Recently, investigators reported that mild sleep restriction induces marked reduction in basal glucagon concentrations [19].",0
"Furthermore, individuals with sleep disorders may be predisposed to insulin resistance and glucose intolerance due to sleep-related dysregulation of the HPA axis with consequent elevations in serum cortisol [16,45].",0
"In a community dwelling sample of 2,751 middle aged men and women, Kumari et al reported that short sleep duration and increased sleep disturbance are independently associated with diurnal slope in cortisol secretion [45].",0
"The impact of short sleep duration on the risk of diabetes has been shown in several epidemiological studies, with significant increases in the incidence of diabetes among individuals who report habitual short sleep duration and those who report having difficulty maintaining sleep [4,9-11].",0
"Alternatively, cyclical hypoxemia with re-oxygenation, similar to repeated ischemia-reperfusion damage, may promote the formation of reactive oxygen species that may then elicit the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-Î± [46,47].",0
Investigators have shown that both acute total and short-term partial sleep loss results in elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations [48].,0
"Notably, investigators have reported that short sleep duration and other parameters of sleep disturbance during mid and late pregnancy are associated with increased systematic inflammation and higher stimulated levels of IL-6 [49,50]; and we have previously reported that early pregnancy CRP concentrations are predictive of incident GDM [51].",0
"Collectively, these data suggest that sleep disturbances may augment pro-inflammatory responses that may then contribute to altered glucose metabolism.",0
"Causal biological mechanisms for the observed positive, though statistically in-significant association between long sleep duration and GDM are not clear.",0
"Some investigators, documenting similar positive association between long sleep duration and type 2 diabetes mellitus speculate that the association may be due in part to residual confounding by undiagnosed health conditions, co-morbid depression, unemployment, or poor general health [1,4].",0
"Despite unclear mechanisms, the positive relationship between later pregnancy hyperglycemia and GDM risk were evident among women who reported short/long sleep duration and snoring in our cohort.",0
The risks were particularly elevated among overweight women with these sleep disorders.,0
Conclusion\nThese preliminary findings suggest associations of short sleep duration and snoring with glucose intolerance and GDM.,0
"Moreover, accumulating evidence link habitual snoring and sleep apnea, both part of a spectrum of sleep-related breathing disorders, with cardiometabolic abnormalities that include hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes [2,7,12-15].",0
"Though consistent with studies of men and non-pregnant women, larger prospective studies that include objective measures of sleep duration, sleep quality, and sleep apnea during pregnancy are needed to confirm our findings.",0
Enhanced knowledge of possible metabolic consequences of sleep disturbances in pregnancy will likely have important clinical implications in the prevention and treatment of impaired glucose tolerance and GDM among pregnant women.,0
"Although the exact mechanisms underlying these associations have yet to be fully elucidated, evidence from experimental studies suggest that insufficient sleep and sleep fragmentation result in metabolic and neuroendocrine alterations, particularly alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, that may contribute to the development of impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus [16-20].",0
"Moreover, experimental studies in humans [21,22] and animals [23,24] have demonstrated that intermittent hypoxia, known to occur in sleep apnea, exerts adverse effects on glucose metabolism.",0
"Most sleep studies, however, have excluded pregnant women; hence very little is known about how insufficient sleep and sleep disordered breathing during gestation contribute to increased risks of medical complications of pregnancy including gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).",0
To the best of our knowledge no one has evaluated the impact of sleep duration and snoring on maternal glucose metabolism in pregnancy.,0
"In this pilot study, we assessed associations of maternal self-reported sleep duration and snoring during early pregnancy with glucose intolerance and a diagnosis of GDM later in pregnancy.",0
We hypothesized that maternal habitual short sleep duration and snoring during early pregnancy were positively associated with post load glucose concentrations later in pregnancy and with an increased risk of clinically diagnosed GDM.,0
"Methods\n\nStudy population and setting\nThis preliminary (pilot) study is based on data collected from a cohort of women attending prenatal care clinics affiliated with Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, Washington.",0
"The cohort study was designed to evaluate the influence of maternal diet, physical activity and the other life style factors on the occurrence of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus and other adverse pregnancy outcomes.",0
"Given that pregnant women, particularly those in the first trimester, are known to require 30-45 more minutes of sleep per night than their non-pregnant counterparts [25-27], we a priori defined those women who reported sleeping 9 hours per night as the reference group.",0
"Dietary intake of fish, omega-3, omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin D and the prevalence of psychotic-like symptoms in a cohort of 33 000 women from the general population\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nLow intake of fish, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and vitamin D deficiency has been suggested to play a role in the development of schizophrenia.",0
The effect was most pronounced for omega-6 PUFAs.,0
"The main purpose of the present study was to evaluate the association between the dietary intake of different fish species, the dietary intake of PUFAs (omega-3 and omega-6) and vitamin D and the prevalence of positive psychotic-like symptoms in a population-based study among Swedish women.",0
"We are aware that some arachidonic acid (AA) could be found in fish [27], however, we choose to include those fatty acids that are dominating in fatty fish into the variable ""marine fatty acids"".",0
The associations were J-shaped with the strongest reduced risk for an intermediate intake of fish or PUFA.,0
"However, we were not able take environmental factors and geographic area into account, because the study questionnaire did not assess the origin of fish, such as the Baltic Sea or the Atlantic Ocean.",0
"The category ""low level symptoms group"" (no psychotic-like symptoms) was used as the reference group.",0
"Since, the outcome status (namely psychotic symptoms) among participants was unknown at study entry we cannot draw any conclusions about causality, only about the existence of associations (negative or positive).",0
"For fatty fish (herring/mackerel, salmon-type fish), the strongest inverse association was found for an intermediate intake (RR: 0.81, 95% CI, 0.66-0.98), whereas a high intake of fatty fish was associated with an increased risk of psychotic-like symptoms (RR: 1.90, 95% CI, 1.34-2.70).",0
"Based on the hypothesis under study we interpreted the RR<1 as a negative association (for simplicity we refer to it from now on ""decreased risk"") and RR>1 as a positive association (for simplicity we refer to it from now on as ""increased risk"").",0
The selection of covariates included in the final multivariate models was based on proportional (â‰¥10%) change in Î²-coefficients and previous subject matter knowledge.,0
"We initially tested all covariates, and those included in the final models were considered to be important confounding factors for the relation between the main exposure and psychotic-like symptoms.",0
We decided not to include dietary Vitamin D estimates in the final multivariate models as fish is a rich source of vitamin D and could account for some of the effect of fish on our outcome.,0
"Additionally, there is a high correlation between vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids (correlation = 0.77).",0
"Women in the high level group were more likely to be never drinkers than women in the low level group, the multivariate RR, adjusted for smoking, BMI, education and country of birth, was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-1.8).",0
The remaining dietary intake of different food items and specific nutrients were similar among the three groups of women with different levels of positive psychotic-like symptoms (Table1).,0
"However, there was a J-shaped association between psychotic-like symptoms and fatty fish (herring/mackerel and salmon-type fish) with the strongest inverse association for intermediate dietary intake (RR: 0.81, 95% CI, 0.66-0.98), whereas a high intake (RR: 1.90, 95% CI, 1.34-2.70) of fatty fish was associated with an increased risk of high level psychotic-like symptoms.",0
"In the high level symptoms group compared with the low level symptoms group, the intake of shellfish 1-3 times per month was associated with a reduced risk, whereas the intake of shellfish more than three times per week was associated with an increased risk.",0
The latter result did not remain significant after multivariate adjustment (Table2).,0

"We found support for a protective effect regarding the risk of positive psychotic-like symptoms with high dietary intake of fish, omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA, as well as of vitamin D. The associations were J-shaped with the strongest reduced risk for an intermediate intake of fish or PUFA.",0
Our findings provide further support for the hypothesis that an aberration in lipid metabolism may be involved in the biochemical basis for psychiatric disorders [13].,0
"This suggestion has earlier been supported by ecological studies showing that variations in schizophrenia outcome between countries may be due to differences in the diet [6,14].",0
"Background\nEven though psychoses are relatively rare, between 5-15% of the general population has been estimated to report single schizophrenia-like symptoms like delusions, magical thinking, and hearing internal voices at some point in their lifetime [1-3].",0
Further evidence for the hypothesis that PUFA is involved in the etiology of psychiatric disease has been put forward through the study by Stokes et al.,0
"showing a negative correlation between dietary PUFA intake and the severity of psychotic symptoms [15], as well as studies showing that patients with schizophrenia or depression have lower levels of PUFAs in brain tissue, red blood cells and skin fibroblasts and with a low intake of fish and PUFAs [16,29-31].",0
"Finally, supplementation of PUFA, especially EPA, has been reported to be of possible benefit for patients with schizophrenia [17].",0
No earlier studies that we are aware of have evaluated the relationship between adult vitamin D levels and psychotic symptoms.,0
Our findings indicated a protective effect of vitamin D for the risk of psychotic-like symptoms.,0
Prenatal vitamin D deficiency has been proposed to be a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia [12].,0
"Results from the Northern Finland 1966 Birth Cohort showed that vitamin D supplementation during the first year of life was associated with a reduced risk of schizophrenia in males, but not in women [32].",0
"However, a small pilot study of maternal vitamin D levels in archived prenatal sera, showed no decrease in prenatal vitamin D in subjects who later developed schizophrenia [33].",0
It has been hypothesised that vitamin D insufficiency could account for some of the increased risk of schizophrenia observed among dark-skinned immigrants moving to countries with less sun exposure [12].,0
"Our results of a protective effect of vitamin D intake must be considered as rough, since we only measure the dietary intake of vitamin D. A more complete picture of the vitamin D status could have been supplied through vitamin D levels in blood; however, no biological samples are available.",0
"The absorption of dietary vitamin D is generally high at all stages of life [34], but serum levels also depend on the endogenous production of vitamin D due to sun exposure which is subject to seasonal variations.",0
"The CAPE tool has proven to be a stable, valid and reliable self-report instrument for the measurement of psychotic-like experiences in the general population based on cross-validation with interview-based data [24,25].",0
Another possible explanation may be that the frequent intake of fish and PUFA may be advantageous in lower doses but disadvantageous in higher doses.,0
"The classification of women into three groups with different levels of symptoms (low, middle and high) was based on predefined, but arbitrary cut-offs from the self-reported answers to the CAPE questionnaire.",0
"However, again some misclassification of dietary intake cannot be ruled out, such a misclassification is likely to be non-differential, and attenuating any true association.",0
Future studies are warranted for replication and should evaluate if this is a causal relationship.,0
"Thus, the correlation between vitamin D intake and serum levels may vary.",0
"However, Burgaz et al.",0
recently reported that 2-3 weekly servings of fatty fish increased 25(OH)D by 45% in a population of Swedish women [35].,0
"Our results of the protective effect of fatty fish could in part be due to the content of vitamin D. While the epidemiological evidence linking low prenatal vitamin D and schizophrenia remains inconclusive, rodent models have provided compelling evidence about the role of vitamin D deficiency for brain development like larger lateral volumes [36], subtle memory dysfunction and altered attention processing [37] which have implications for neuropsychiatric disorders.",0
The biological mechanisms underlying the etiology of schizophrenia and psychotic symptoms are largely unknown.,0
"Unexpectedly, the intake of fatty fish (salmon, herring and mackerel) or shellfish more than twice a week increased the risk of being in the group with the highest level of psychotic-like symptoms.",0
This puzzling finding may be due to unknown or known unhealthy constituents of fatty fish.,0
"For instance, environmental pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and dioxins are known to accumulate in fatty fish [38].",0
Reports by Mischoulon et al.,0
and Peet & Horrobin suggest that there might be such a therapeutic window for DHA and EPA regarding their protective role for schizophrenia or depression [39-41].,0
"Genetic constitution is important [4], but environmental factors like an unhealthy lifestyle with a poor diet may be involved [5,6].",0
Significant higher levels of DHA have been found in red cell membranes of un-medicated schizophrenic patients compared to healthy control subjects [42].,0
"Furthermore, our findings of a more pronounced protective effect of omega-6 fatty acids than for omega-3 fatty acid are in agreement with the results from an EPA supplementation study in schizophrenia presented by Horrobins et al.",0
"This study surprisingly found that the effect of intermediate doses of EPA increased the levels of AA (an omega-6 PUFA) in the membrane of red cells, whereas higher doses of EPA did not, and the EPA-induced rise in AA was associated with a clinical improvement.",0
The respective biological effects of omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids on the etiology of psychiatric symptoms could very well differ and the balance between the intakes of these fatty acids might be of importance.,0
"It has been proposed that the ratio of omega-3:omega-6 fatty acids might be more important in inhibiting the development of several diseases, including cancer, inflammatory and heart diseases [45,46].",0
"We find no support for this in our results, since, the effect of omega-3:omega-6 fatty acids on psychotic-like symptoms were almost similar to those of omega-3 fatty acids.",0
"However, the mechanisms of action and protective abilities of PUFA could differ between different diseases.",0
The non-linearity in the association might seemingly argue against a possible causal relationship.,0
"However, the associations with dietary components and health are often non-linear with advantageous effects of a balanced nutrition [47-50].",0
We have no baseline measure of symptom levels to further elucidate causality between different levels of intake of fatty fish or shellfish and the risk of positive psychotic-like symptoms.,0
"However, keeping the prevalence figures for psychotic disorders in mind, rather few participants in our population sample are likely to have a disorder, which may diminish the problem of reversed causality related to psychotic diagnosis or medication.",0
Schizophrenia in adulthood is often preceded by milder symptoms and delusions during adolescence.,0
"In our study, the definition of psychotic-like symptoms was based on self-reported frequency of psychosis-like experiences.",0
"Our aim was to evaluate the association between the intake of different fish species, PUFA and vitamin D and the prevalence of psychotic-like symptoms in a population-based study among Swedish women.",0
We acknowledge the limitation that the scale have not been used earlier in Sweden and validated in the Swedish population.,0
These characteristics are often seen in patients with psychotic disorders [51-53].,0
Meta-analysis [8] and prospective follow-up studies indicates that up to 75-90% of developmental psychotic experiences are transitory.,0
"Based on the sum population prevalence of schizophrenia and other psychoses in middle-aged women [54], we might expect that 2-3% of the study participants would cross the boundaries to clinically valid syndromes.",0
"The CAPE measures of psychosis are strongly correlated with measures of general psychopathology, including depression.",0
"The association between the positive and the depressive dimension in CAPE, which we unfortunately could not include for practical reasons, is fairly low when distress associated with positive symptoms is held constant (r = 0.25; Stefanis et al., 2002 [1]).",0
"Thus, there are reasons to believe that the dimension of positive symptoms is an independent dimension.",0
In terms of generalisability of our results it is relevant to compare the levels of dietary intake of PUFAs and vitamin D in our cohort to other populations.,0
Persistence and clinical relevant impairment may be related to a family history of schizophrenia and environmental risk factors that might interact with the genetic risk.,0
The contribution of dietary intakes of PUFAs to total dietary fat is comparable to other Western cohorts [55].,0
"The quotient omega-6 PUFA/omega-3 PUFA was 4:1 in this study, and this value is comparable to other European cohorts [56,57], but lower than that has been reported for US populations (Food and Nutrition Board.",0
The dietary intake of vitamin D in this cohort is comparable to several other European populations [58].,0
It is relevant to note that in Sweden low-fat dairy products and margarines are fortified with vitamin D. Otherwise the dietary intake of vitamin D would be lower.,0
"Furthermore, men were not included in the study and there is gender difference in the prevalence of psychosis [59].",0
However psychotic-like experiences in the general population might be more equally distributed among women and men [60].,0
The strengths of our study include its thorough diet data design and large sample size.,0
"The ethnic homogeneity of our study population reduces the risk of confounding by unmeasured factors, both genetic and environmental.",0
"We were able to adjust for smoking, BMI, migration, education and alcohol that could confound our associations between diet and psychotic-like symptoms.",0
"We had no information about socioeconomic status, but the adjustment for education, which is strongly associated with socioeconomic status, did not change the estimates.",0
"Still, we cannot rule out that there are unknown confounders that we have not been adjusted for, for example drugs influencing levels of serum lipids or family history of psychiatric illness.",0
"If the proportion of non-urbanized participants was high in the study population this could have confounded our results, nevertheless this is not the case in the Swedish population.",0
"Misclassification of fish and PUFA or vitamin D intake due to measurement error associated with the food frequency questionnaire is unavoidable, but given the study design likely non-differential, and thus attenuating any true association.",0
It is also relevant to note that Hibbeln et al.,0
Self-reported psychotic experiences in the general population may represent the developmental expression of population genetic risk for psychosis [9].,0
"reported high correlations (r = 0.7) between the dietary intake of EPA and DHA and serum levels of EPA and DHA in subjects with schizophrenia [51], indicating a good ability to report dietary intake accurately.",0
"An important limitation of this study is that we measured dietary intake only once, involving misclassification among those who changed their dietary pattern during follow-up.",0
"Low maternal fish and seafood consumption during pregnancy is reported to increase the risk for a low IQ and suboptimal neuro-developmental outcomes in childhood [10], factors that in turn are associated with an increased risk for adult mental disorders like schizophrenia [11].",0
"Unfortunately, we do not have information about specific vitamin D supplementation.",0
"But, adjustment for multivitamin supplement intake, containing vitamin D, did not change the estimates.",0
"Unfortunately, we do not have any information about the use of such supplements during follow-up.",0
"However, according to national figures from the National Food Administration, a low number of Swedish women took fish oil supplements (1%) at the time of the study.",0
"The drop-outs had a slightly higher BMI, lower education and were more often smokers and born outside of the Nordic countries.",0
"However, our main exposure (fish/fatty acids) did not differ between those who participated and those who did not participate in the study.",0
"Conclusions\nIn conclusion, in this large-scale cohort of Swedish women we found that a frequent consumption of fish, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids appears to reduce the risk of positive psychotic-like symptoms.",0
"The associations for fatty fish or shellfish were J-shaped, with the strongest inverse association for an intermediate dietary intake, whereas a high intake was associated with a higher rate of high level psychotic-like symptoms.",0
A recent meta-analysis found a latitude related increase in schizophrenia prevalence that was greater for groups with low fish consumption [12].,0
"Interestingly, we found a lower rate of psychotic-like symptoms with increasing vitamin D intake.",0
There are no current studies that can give real good answers to the question if dietary deficiency interacts with genetic vulnerability for schizophrenia.,0
Schizophrenia is a multifactorial disorder with strong genetic vulnerability and the vulnerability might include metabolic aberrations.,0
"Further, it would be of interest to study if dietary aspects are associated with separable latent dimensions of positive psychotic-like symptoms and if the associations are valid for men and for other age groups.",0
"Fatty fish is a rich dietary source of essential fatty acids and vitamin D, both of which could be implicated in the development of schizophrenia.",0
"For instance, it has been proposed that aberration in metabolism of phospholipids could be a biochemical basis for psychiatric disorders [13].",0
"Although, only hypothesis generating, two ecological studies support the hypothesis by reporting the ratio of saturated fat to PUFA in the diet is a strong predictor of schizophrenia outcome, measured as according to either clinical or to social variables [6,14].",0
"Also, the dietary intake of PUFA was negatively correlated with the severity of psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia [15].",0
"Lower levels of PUFA have been found in brain content, red blood cells and skin fibroblast among patients with schizophrenia, compared with a healthy population [13,16].",0
"Results from a review of several randomized clinical trials of PUFA treatment of schizophrenia were inconclusive, although, it seems that supplementation of especially EPA to these patients may have a positive effect on their schizophrenic symptoms [17].",0
"Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that prenatal vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for schizophrenia, supported by the role of this vitamin in cell growth and differentiation, the excess of winter births in schizophrenia (a period when vitamin D levels are low), and increased births of pre-schizophrenic subjects in urban areas, where vitamin D deficiency is higher [12,18].",0
"However, to our knowledge, no study has investigated the association between dietary intake of fish, omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA or vitamin D and the risk of having positive psychotic symptoms in the general adult population.",0
"Season of Birth and Risk for Adult Onset Glioma\n\nAbstract\nAdult onset glioma is a rare cancer which occurs more frequently in Caucasians than African Americans, and in men than women.",0
Several recent studies have reported an association between season of birth and glioma risk.,0
"Dryness, rashes, and related skin conditions, to which infants may be particularly susceptible, serve to disrupt the protective barrier of the skin [36,38].",0
"(Pesticides also are used outside the farm in urban schools, homes, and day-care centers for control of roaches, rats, and other vermin, and conceivably their peak period of application may differ seasonally from that on farms [33,40].)",0
"While farmers live longer than the population-at-large [41], and die less frequently from cancer in general [42], several epidemiologic studies have found an increased risk for brain cancer in this group [43â€“50].",0
"Farmers represent a diverse group (e.g., with dairy, field crop, hog, beef cattle, poultry, fish, marijuana, cotton, and organic), and the heterogeneity of brain cancer risk for farmers could reflect differences in activities, as well as in the type, magnitude, and seasonality of exposures.",0
"Within this window the peak for immune system priming or susceptibility is believed to vary differentially in response to presenting antigens [53,54].",0
"Contact with allergens during early childhood may enhance the risk of developing allergies later in life, especially in individuals with a predisposition for atopic and allergic conditions [51,55].",0
"Efforts to reduce allergen exposure immediately after birth often only delay the onset of allergic conditions, rather than preventing it, suggesting that immunologic memory may predate birth [15].",0
"While genetics constitute a key determinant of immunologic memory and immune system maturation [56â€“58], environmental factors also are believed to play an important role in the development of allergies, as illustrated by the discordance of allergies in twin studies [59], the increasing prevalence of atopic diseases over time [15,60], and the different incidence of allergies in immigrant and country of origin populations [61].",0
"In a number of studies, season of birth has been associated with the development of allergic conditions later in life, such as asthma [61â€“65], atopic dermatitis [66], house dust mite allergy [60,61,65,67â€“69], cockroach allergy [70,71], grass/birch/hay and other pollen allergy [51,60,63,67,68,72â€“76], animal dander allergy [51,67], mold allergy [74], food allergy [51,55,67], allergic rhinitis [62,77], and otherwise unspecified atopy (NOS) [55,78].",0
"This paper reviews the plausibility of evidence focusing on the seasonal interrelation of farming, allergies, viruses, vitamin D, diet, birth weight, and handedness.",0
"Factors known to influence the development of asthma include race [80,81], low yearly family income [81], less than a high school education [81], residence in high poverty areas [81], exposure to urban air pollution [64] and childhood viral infections [64,82].",0
"Asthma, allergies, and other atopic diseases have been inversely associated with adult glioma risk in several epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses [83â€“93], although some reports do not support this conclusion [94â€“98].",0
The exact biologic mechanisms underlying a protective effect are not clearly understood.,0
"It has been suggested that the inverse association may reflect increased immune surveillance on the part of the atopic individual [91,93].",0
"Glioma patients are known to suffer from an impaired immune system [99], and the reduced association with allergies alternatively could be due to immunosuppression induced by the tumor ( i.e ., reverse causality) [84].",0
Inflammatory responses also may favor tumor development [93].,0
"Being raised on a farm [102â€“114] or in a rural area [115] has been shown in some studies to protect against asthma, hay fever, and atopic sensitization.",0
"Although farm children are exposed to higher concentrations of airborne allergens, paradoxically they become sensitized less often and manifest a weaker sensitization response than non-farm controls [113].",0
Some researchers have hypothesized that the protective effect may be attributed to a form of â€œtoleranceâ€.,0
"Such tolerance could conceivably develop early in life, following repeated exposure to high levels of allergens such as organic dusts, fungi, and endotoxins; this is perhaps the result of component lipopolysaccharides that excite Th1 responses and suppress the development of immunoglobulin-E (IgE)-antibodies [109,116].",0
Little is known about specific determinants of asthma and atopy in the farm setting.,0
"Any relationship with glioma risk is probably complex and must be interpreted in light of differences in farming practices and the protective ability of farming environments, especially with respect to microbial exposures [102,103,114].",0
"To date, a convincing explanation for the occurrence of adult gliomas decades after a seasonal exposure at birth remains elusive.",0
"While farmers and their families have greater contact with seasonal elements, they may be less prone to â€œsick building syndromeâ€ than residents of urban areas [117].",0
"Other mitigating factors may include a greater intake of saturated fat in the form of milk and butter, as well as a greater number of older siblings living at home in rural/farm communities [116].",0
"Furthermore, farmers usually are non-smokers and healthier than the population-at-large [43,116,118â€“120].",0
"By self-selection, those who manifest seasonal allergies may choose a career path other than farming (i.e., healthy worker effect) [116].",0
"Differences in the definition of atopy, a lack of objective measures of atopy, residual confounding, and bias (e.g., detection, selection, interview, recall) are important to consider when interpreting the above studies [92,121].",0
"Despite considerable efforts to unravel the etiologic basis for this cancer and attempts to find a cure, gliomas largely remain refractory to treatment.",0
"Furthermore, regarding the role of allergies and immunity, there is no clear trend toward a decreasing risk for glioma with younger ages at onset of the allergic condition [121].",0
"Interestingly, increased risk for glioma has been observed in patients with AIDS-related immuno-suppression [122â€“124], but not in those with iatrogenic immuno-suppression [125].",0
"Viruses\nEnvironmental exposures to viruses, microbes and other pathogens generally tend to occur more often in particular seasons [25,126,127].",0
Polyomaviruses have been shown to induce brain tumors in animals [128â€“131] and have been detected in human gliomas [132].,0
Other neuro-oncogenic viruses implicated in gliomas under laboratory conditions include human adenovirus type 12 and Rous sarcoma virus [133].,0
"Some tumor viruses must be injected in animals on the first day of life to be effective, although they may not cause cancer until years later [7].",0
Epidemiologic evidence in support of a viral or pathogenic etiology for adult brain tumors remains controversial and the windows of interest of these studies have been outside the perinatal period.,0
"In adults, Toxoplasma gondii infection has been associated with a greater prevalence of astrocytomas [134], while decreased glioma risk has been associated with a history of infections/colds [88], and chicken pox [135,136].",0
"On the other hand, increased risk for childhood brain tumors has been associated in some studies with a history of chicken pox [137], influenza [138,139], measles [138], general viral infections [140,141], and neonatal urinary tract infections [141].",0
Bacterial urinary tract infections have been shown to follow a well defined seasonal pattern with a peak in August [127].,0
"Similarly, seasonal occurrence has been observed for chicken pox, measles, influenza and many other common childhood infectious diseases [7,142].",0
A seasonal infectious etiology for disease is complicated by many factors [126].,0
The same infectious agent may present a different pattern of incidence depending on the host location.,0
A seasonal peak evident in the general population may not behave uniformly within certain subpopulations.,0
"Temperature, humidity, precipitation, and indoor air quality are among the mitigating factors that may affect the survival and transmissibility of a pathogen and explain different seasonal peaks for a disease in different studies.",0
"Furthermore, seasonal variation in immune function may increase host susceptibility to infections at certain times of the year [143,144].",0
"Given the rarity of some infections and brain tumors, the interpretability of seasonal patterns, or the lack thereof, may be confounded by time- and/or space-dependent factors [126].",0
"Maternal serum vitamin D levels tend to be closely correlated with infant cord serum levels [146,147].",0
"This light synthesized steroid, resulting from the absorption of ultraviolet B photons by 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin [148], has been suggested as a possible factor underlying the season of birth risk for adult gliomas observed in some studies [145].",0
"However, the attributable risk for these factors is small and can only explain a fraction of cases.",0
"Levels of vitamin D are known to fluctuate depending on sunlight exposure, which is highest in the summer for the northern hemisphere and tends to increase for latitudes nearer the equator [145,148â€“150].",0
"Antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity of vitamin D3 has been noted in model glioma cell lines and a primary culture, as well as tumor tissue experiments [145].",0
"Further, prenatal vitamin D3 depletion has been associated with altered brain development in rodent studies [151].",0
"Vitamin D receptors are present in most cells and tissues in the body [152], including the brain [148], so this hormone is believed to play an important role in disease management and cancer prevention as a modulator of immune system activity [148,153â€“155].",0
"Children who live in polluted, inner city environments and who are deprived of regular sunlight exposure have been shown to suffer a higher prevalence of rickets (due to vitamin D deficiency) than children in rural areas [148].",0
"Seasonal variation in vitamin D levels also has been suggested as a factor differentially affecting newborn growth plate width, and this may explain why babies born in Australia around October (spring) are relatively heavier than those born at other times [156].",0
Diet\nThe â€œdevelopmental plasticity hypothesisâ€ refers to the critical developmental period in utero when the fetus is plastic and adaptively imprints to its environment.,0
"In utero adaptation may lead to lifelong changes in the bodyâ€™s metabolism, hormone regulation, and the number of cells present in key organs [14,157,158].",0
"If this is the case, adult health outcomes may reflect season of birth if food intake is seasonal, and if exposure occurs at a critical stage of fetal development.",0
Evidence of an association between adult-onset glioma and date of birth suggests an etiologic role for a seasonally variable environmental exposure occurring prenatally around the time of birth.,0
Foods high in N-nitroso compounds have been associated with an increased risk for brain tumors in some studies [162â€“165].,0
These compounds may be present in foods through their use as preservatives or in fertilizers [166].,0
"An 18-fold greater risk of primary adult brain tumors has been found among individuals who consumed large amounts of processed meats (high in N-nitroso content) and drank orange/grapefruit juice once per week or less, than among those who consumed less processed meat and drank orange/grapefruit juice more often [164].",0
"However, a recent multi-centered international case-control study of adult diet and brain tumor risk found no evidence of confounding or effect modification by vitamin supplementation, especially in the association between consumption of cured meats (containing high levels of nitrates) and gliomas [167].",0
"High birth weight is an important predictor of adult obesity [171], and a higher body mass index (BMI) has been linked to greater risk for adult-onset glioma [172].",0
"In children, high birth weight has been associated with increased risk for astrocytoma and medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) [173].",0
Temporal patterns in birth weight may result from seasonal variations in food availability.,0
"Interestingly, very low birth weight has been associated with left- or mix-handedness [175,176], a factor associated in some studies with season of birth [177] and reduced glioma risk [178].",0
"Similarly, exposure to asbestos 70 years prior to the development of mesothelioma [4], suggests a â€œone insult, co-carcinogenic modelâ€ of cancer development [5].",0
"Handedness\nHandedness is believed to be determined in utero [179], possibly through hormonal influences [180â€“183], and has been linked with immune disease [184,185], various developmental learning disorders [184], epilepsy [186], and breast cancer risk in both pre- and post-menopausal women [187â€“190].",0
"Exposure to a high level of testosterone during the earlier part of pregnancy is thought to promote right brain development and influence hand preference, although the evidence in support of a relationship is not conclusive [191].",0
"Testosterone, progesterone, oestradiol, and lutenising hormone levels in women have been reported to be higher in spring than in autumn [192â€“194].",0
Results from several studies hint that non-genetic factors may play an important role in the determination of handedness.,0
"Similarly, left-handedness has been linked to congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a condition characterized by high in utero levels of androgeizing hormones [197].",0
"Of note, brain tumors are known to contain sex steroid receptors (e.g., estrogen, androgen, progestin) [198], and sex hormones have been shown to promote brain tumors in animal studies [199,200].",0
"Risk factors that may exhibit seasonal epidemicity include exposure to infectious agents, allergens, pesticides, indoor environmental tobacco smoke, and other sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., soot from fires for home heating), and use of antihistamines.",0
"Mice reared under conditions favoring the right limb develop a right-limb preference, and vice versa [201], further suggesting that environmental factors influence handedness.",0
"Additionally, the discordance of handedness in twin studies illustrates that genetics alone cannot explain the development of handedness [202â€“207].",0
Being right-handed has been associated with a greater risk for glioma than being left-handed or ambidextrous [178].,0
"However, for left-handed and ambidextrous participants born from late fall through early spring, glioma risk also has been shown to be higher than for those born at other times of the year [16].",0
"A study of 15,390 Brazilian students was unable to detect a difference in the season of birth between right- and left-handers.",0
"Other putative candidates include harmonic variation in population mixing, diet, temperature, humidity, sunlight/photoperiod, levels of vitamin D3, and endogenous hormones [6,7].",0
"The putative connection between handedness, season of birth, and glioma risk remains difficult to interpret.",0
"For example, glioma risk is greater for males than females [2], yet the pattern of seasonal influence upon handedness does not vary significantly between females and males [177].",0
A higher incidence of sinistrality has been observed for individuals born in winter and autumn than for those born summer and spring [191].,0
"The incidence of left-handedness is disproportionately higher among males [202], a finding which is consistently observed across species [201,209â€“212].",0
"Overall, handedness appears to be a surrogate marker for an underlying but unidentified risk factor that interacts with seasonality and other factors to possibly explain glioma risk.",0
Discussion\nSeason of birth in its own right cannot be deemed a cause for glioma.,0
"Rather, it is a surrogate marker for underlying risk factors that may offer subtle clues about the possible perinatal etiology of adult gliomas.",0
There is probably no specific etiologic agent acting in isolation that completely explains a season of birth association with adult glioma risk.,0
"If an association exists the effect probably represents the interplay between various environmental, genetic, lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors, operating on mother and child within a precise window of vulnerability.",0
The mechanism of action may involve epigenetic processes or DNA changes with the capacity to modulate or influence oncogenic outcomes in the distant future.,0
The origins of many childhood and adult malignancies are believed to be determined during a finite perinatal window.,0
"A patientâ€™s innate and adaptive immune response and a host of hormonal and metabolic factors, likely play important and closely interrelated roles in understanding the complex biologic and etiologic mechanisms in the season of birth effect for adult gliomas.",0
"In the studies conducted to date, risk estimates and p-values for the association between season of birth and glioma risk have been nominal to borderline in strength.",0
"However, a weak association does not necessarily imply the absence of causality, nor is a strong association necessary or sufficient for causality [213,214].",0
The ability to find associations between specific seasonal risk factors occurring around the time of birth and adult glioma incidence is limited by the rarity of this cancer in the population and the vast time period from exposure to disease.,0
"During this period the brain and immune systems are less developed, undergoing greater cell growth and differentiation, and possibly more susceptible to DNA and epigenetic changes underlying cancer development in the near or distant future [5,8â€“13].",0
"While the risk factors outlined in this review do not conflict with our current understanding of the natural history of cancer or glioma specifically, the evidence in support of a causal relationship has not been consistent.",0
"To some degree, effect modification or publication bias may explain the inconsistencies.",0
"At minimum, if a causal relationship exists, season of birth meets the criteria of temporality as the period surrounding birth clearly predates disease occurrence.",0
"In this model, environmental exposures and lifestyle changes that occur afterwards play a mainly secondary role to the programming or imprinting that occurs during pregnancy and/or early infancy [14,15].",0
"However, the exact window of exposure when the underlying risk factor(s) most occur to cause disease is unknown.",0
"On the present evidence, it is not possible to definitively answer the question of how season of birth influences glioma risk, or to favor any specific hypothesis.",0
"Many questions remain and future research will benefit from focused studies aimed at specific exposures and subpopulations, allowing for more detailed analyses by histologic subtypes.",0
The etiology of this disease is largely unknown.,0
"Review of Literature\nSeveral recent studies have explored season of birth as a risk factor for adult glioma, but results have been mixed (Table 1).",0
"Three independent reports have observed a peak risk for winter births [16â€“18], while no seasonal variation for risk was noted in two other epidemiologic studies [19,20].",0
"A multi-centered study of four Midwest states examining rural and farm exposures observed a statistically significant increased risk of adult gliomas for springtime births, but only among those born â€œoffâ€ a farm [21].",0
"Similarly, the study of childhood brain tumors and season of birth have yielded equivocal results [22â€“26].",0
"Exposure to ionizing radiation is the only well established environmental risk factor, and this factor explains only a small percentage of cases.",0
Risk Factors Related To Season of Birth\nThe underlying rationale for the occurrence of a glioma decades after a seasonal exposure remains elusive.,0
No specific etiologic agent to date has been identified to support such a long induction period for this cancer.,0
"Several hypothetical arguments have been offered in explanation of a season of birth effect for adult gliomas, if such an association exists.",0
"Thus far, the major evidence in support of a seasonal effect involves farming, allergies/immunity, viruses, and vitamin D. Other possible factors related to seasonal birth are diet, birth weight, and handedness.",0
"Many farm chemicals are classified as probable or likely human carcinogens by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), most notably acephate, dichlorvos, dimethoate, lindane, parathion, phosmet, and tetrachlorvinphos [28].",0
"Household dust concentrations of azinphosmethyl, chlorpyrifos, parathion, and phosmet have been found to be significantly higher in farmer or farmworker homes than in referent homes [29].",0
"Homes with high pet activities have been shown to have greater levels of pesticide residues in sampled carpet dust than homes with low pet activities [31,32].",0
"In tandem with living on a farm, infants have unique vulnerabilities that may lead to higher levels of exposures in the same environment than adults [9].",0
Asthma and Allergic Diseases in Pregnancy: A Review\n\nAbstract\nAsthma and allergic disorders can affect the course and outcome of pregnancy.,0
Specific pharmacological agents for treatment of asthma or allergic diseases must be cautiously selected and are discussed here with respect to safety considerations in pregnancy.,0
"Although most of the existing data regarding asthma and allergy medications during pregnancy have not demonstrated adverse effects, data regarding the use of oral corticosteroids have not been totally reassuring.",0
"In a recently published meta-analysis,[12] 6 cohort studies evaluating the relationship between first trimester maternal use of oral corticosteroids and congenital malformations did not show an increased risk of congenital malformations (summary odds ratio, 1.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.08-2.60).",0
"However, meta-analysis of the 4 case-control studies revealed a significantly increased risk of oral clefts in infants of corticosteroid-treated mothers (odds ratio, 3.35; confidence interval 1.97-5.69) [12].",0
"Other adverse outcomes have also been attributed to oral corticosteroids, including an increased risk of preeclampsia,[13,14] preterm birth,[12,15] and lower birth weight [16].",0
"However, the potential side effects of any drug must be balanced against the risks of the mother or the infant having inadequately treated disease.",0
"In the case of asthma, the risk of uncontrolled severe asthma (which may include maternal or fetal mortality) would usually be the greater risk, suggesting that oral corticosteroids must still be used when indicated for the management of severe gestational asthma.",0
These alterations are primarily the result of hormonal effects.,0
They could potentially affect the course of asthma and predispose to hypoxia.,0
"Although most drugs do not harm the fetus, this knowledge is incomplete.",0
"Preexisting asthma symptoms may worsen, improve, or remain unchanged during pregnancy.",0
Each of these 3 possibilities are observed in about one third of all cases [10].,0
Part 1: Specific Allergic Diseases in Pregnancy\n\nEpidemiology: Prevalence of Asthma and Allergy in Pregnant Women\nAllergic sensitization to common allergens can be detected in approximately 25% to 35% of the general population in industrialized countries [7].,0
"Safety of Asthma and Allergy Medication in Pregnancy\nThe ideal situation during pregnancy is ""no pharmacological therapy,"" especially during the first trimester.",0
Caption (FIG): FIGURE 1\n\nPotential side effects of any drug taken during pregnancy by the mother must be balanced againts the risk of the mother of the infant suffering from inadequately treated symptoms .,0
Patients whose asthma is not controlled with maximal doses of bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory agents may need systemic corticosteroids.,0
"However, maternal hypoxia or hypotension associated with anaphylaxis may be catastrophic not only to the mother but also to her fetus.",0
Drug Allergy\nThere is a lack of data on the prevalence of adverse drug reactions during pregnancy.,0
"[""Allergy diagnosis during pregnancy should preferentially consist of recording the patient's history for precise recommendation of allergen avoidance and in vitro testing only.""]",0
"In vivo testing should generally be postponed until after pregnancy, unless diagnosis for therapeutic intervention is urgently needed.",0
"Maternal Diet During Lactation\nRegarding maternal lactation diets, a Cochrane database meta-analysis [99] found some evidence of reduced atopic dermatitis, but suggested that more studies are needed.",0
"In general, patients with severe asthma are more likely to experience worsening of their disease during pregnancy.",0
"Alterations in maternal immunity, particularly a decrease in cell-mediated immunity, may predispose the pregnant asthmatic to infections and thus to acute exacerbations of asthma.",0
"Severe or poorly controlled asthma may be associated with an increased risk of fetal death, low birth weight, congenital malformations,[18] and parental complications [14].",0
Pregnant patients with severe or uncontrolled asthma should be considered high-risk and be treated promptly and optimally to ensure a favorable outcome for mother and baby.,0
"Thus, optimal asthma treatment is crucial, as the risk of preeclampsia, premature birth, low birth weight,[19] and maternal and neonatal hypoxia and morbidity [10,20] posed by undertreated asthma may be greater than that from the use of oral steroids for the treatment of asthma.",0
"Management of Chronic Asthma\nThe goals of management during pregnancy are the same as those for asthma in general, including prevention of severe exacerbations, improvement of quality of life (no interference with sleep or daily activities), and maintenance of normal lung function.",0
Frequent regular follow-up visits to or by health professionals skilled in managing asthma are essential to ensure optimal success and safety of asthma management during pregnancy.,0
"The importance of effective 3-way communication among the patient, asthma specialist, and obstetrician cannot be overemphasized.",0
Any drug may carry a small risk that must be balanced against the benefits of keeping the mother and baby healthy.,0
Patients should have easy access to their physicians during times of increased symptoms.,0
The recommendations for medical treatment have been summarized by a Working Group of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program in a report on managing asthma during pregnancy [21].,0
"A stepwise approach is suggested for medical treatment, where inhaled salbutamol is the preferred short-acting Î² agonist with an outstanding safety profile, and inhaled corticosteroids (eg, budesonide) should be used confidently as long-term control medications.",0
Salmeterol is the preferred agent when long-acting Î²2 agonists are indicated in pregnant women as add-on treatment of persistent asthma.,0
Leukotriene modifiers may be used as alternative add-on treatment; montelukast and zafirlukast are the preferred antileukotriene drugs (but zileuton is not).,0
The lowest possible effective dose (alternate-day dose or single daily dose) should be used.,0
"Patients must be monitored closely for potential adverse effects of corticosteroids, especially gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth retardation.",0
"The goals and principles of management for acute and chronic asthma, rhinitis, and dermatologic disorders are the same during pregnancy as those for asthma in the general population.",0
"Management of Acute Asthma\nTreatment of acute asthma is similar to that recommended for nonpregnant patients including inhaled Î²2agonists, oxygen (essential), and corticosteroids (oral or parenteral) [22].",0
It is also reasonable to add nebulized ipratropium bromide in patients who do not respond to Î²2agonists.,0
Intravenous aminophylline is not generally recommended in the emergency management of acute asthma (because of its potentially harmful effects) but may be used in pregnant patients hospitalized for acute asthma (theophylline levels should be monitored).,0
Criteria for admission and hospital management of the pregnant woman with acute asthma should be more lenient than for nonpregnant patients.,0
Intravenous magnesium sulfate may be beneficial in acute severe asthma as an adjunct to inhaled Î²2agonists and corticosteroids.,0
Pregnancy-associated hormones have direct and indirect effects on nasal blood flow and mucous glands.,0
Allergic rhinitis is often preexisting but may occur or be recognized for the first time during pregnancy.,0
"As with asthma, preexisting AR can worsen, improve, or remain unchanged during pregnancy [27].",0
"Furthermore, during pregnancy, nasal congestion can worsen, although the exact mechanism for this is not defined.",0
"[""Diagnosis of allergy during pregnancy should mainly consist of the patient's history and in vitro testing.""]",0
"The general principles of treatment of pregnant women with asthma [21,22,28] and AR [29] do not differ from the stepwise approach recommended for treatment of nonpregnant women.",0
"Intranasal cromolyn, intranasal steroids, and montelukast are the preferred drugs for the treatment of rhinitis because of the low risk of systemic effects.",0
"Second-generation antihistamines such as loratadine or cetirizine [21,29] can also be used (after the first trimester--as a general precaution).",0
"Anaphylaxis\nThe exact prevalence of anaphylaxis during pregnancy is unknown, but it is extremely uncommon [30].",0
The fetus seems to be relatively protected from anaphylaxis perhaps because the placenta does not transmit specific IgE antibodies to the fetus [31].,0
"Maternal anaphylaxis has been associated with fetal distress, brain injury, and fetal loss (presumably because of diminished uteroplacental perfusion), as well as neonatal death [32-35].",0
"The assured and well-evaluated risk factors revealed for sensitization in mother and child are very limited, to date, and include alcohol consumption, exposure to tobacco smoke, maternal diet and diet of the newborn, drug usage, and insufficient exposure to environmental bacteria.",0
Any agent that can cause anaphylaxis in the nonpregnant state could also cause anaphylaxis in the susceptible or sensitized pregnant patient.,0
Even breast-feeding has been associated with anaphylaxis in 2 postpartum women.,0
Changing levels of progesterone and triggering by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were suggested as potential causes [36].,0
"Of the routine antianaphylaxis medications, epinephrine and diphenhydramine have been implicated in causing fetal malformations.",0
"However, the tentative nature of these data and the lack of equally effective substitutes justify their use in pregnancy for this life-threatening emergency.",0
Adequate intravascular volume repletion and oxygenation are particularly important in the management of anaphylaxis during pregnancy to prevent both maternal and fetal complications.,0
The pregnant hypotensive patient should be placed on her left side to prevent added positional hypotension resulting from compression of the inferior vena cava by the gravid uterus [37].,0
Intravenous epinephrine may be required despite its potential to cause decreased uteroplacental blood flow.,0
"Consequently, the recommendations for primary and secondary preventive measures are also very limited in number and verification.",0
Glucocorticoids should be administered early to patients with severe anaphylaxis.,0
"For laryngeal spasm, intubation and, in rare cases, tracheotomy may be necessary.",0
Adverse Reactions to Food\nNo studies have focused explicitly on the prevalence of food allergy in pregnant women primarily because often the immune response in the offspring is the main focus of research.,0
"A cohort study on the Isle of Wight, United Kingdom, found adverse reactions to food in approximately 20% of 969 pregnant women [38].",0
"From murine studies, it may be expected that the sensitization of a mother to a (food) allergen will also bias the immune response of the offspring toward Th2 [39,40].",0
"However, the exact prevalence of allergic forms of dermatitis in the pregnant population is not known.",0
"The importance of an exacerbation of eczema and dermatitis during pregnancy should not be underestimated as readout of the atopic state, being of interest for the genetic predisposition of the newborn [42].",0
The course is variable [43].,0
"Treatment of atopic dermatitis during pregnancy should emphasize avoidance of triggering factors and reliance on topical treatment in an attempt to reduce dryness and pruritus, modulate inflammation, and treat secondary infections.",0
"Oral antihistamines should be avoided during the first trimester, unless definitely clinically indicated, and then should be used at the lowest effective dose, starting with chlorpheniramine, loratadine, or cetirizine.",0
"Topical steroids should be selected based on potency considerations, given the potential for systemic absorption and increased skin surface area of pregnancy.",0
Severe intrauterine growth retardation occurred in the infant of a mother who applied 40 mg/d of topical triamcinolone cream from week 12 to 29 of gestation to treat her atopic dermatitis [44].,0
"Topical corticosteroid treatment should be initiated when clinically indicated, with the least potent preparations such as hydrocortisone (0.5% to 1%), reserving more potent preparations for more recalcitrant areas in selected patients.",0
"The recently introduced topical calcineurin inhibitors (pimecrolimus and tacrolimus), although effective in the treatment of atopic eczema, are not recommended for use in pregnant patients because of the lack of safety data.",0
Urticaria and Angioedema\nThe pattern and causes of urticaria and angioedema in pregnancy are similar to those in nonpregnant patients.,0
"A unique form of urticaria associated with pregnancy, which tends to recur in subsequent pregnancies ( pregnancy urticaria ), has been reported [45].",0
"The pathogenesis of this condition is unknown, although there is speculation that it may be caused by allergic sensitization to endogenous hormones [46,47].",0
"Antihistamines should be avoided if possible, but if required, chlorpheniramine, loratadine, or cetirizine may be used.",0
"Allergies or hyperreactivities have been classified by Gells and Coombs into types I through IV, with types I, II, and III being mediated by antibodies or immune complexes and type IV reactions as well as chronic stages of allergic diseases being mediated by T cells [1].",0
"Rarely, systemic corticoids may be used for severe recalcitrant urticaria and angioedema during pregnancy.",0
Diagnosis of Allergy During Pregnancy\nThe diagnosis of allergy in pregnant women should focus on a detailed medical history and symptom analysis.,0
"For diagnosis, a diary of allergy symptoms and avoidance of specific allergens accompanied by monitoring of changes of allergic symptoms may be helpful.",0
"However, it is important not to put the mother on a rigid elimination diet because this could negatively influence the nutrition of both the mother and the growing infant [48].",0
The focus of this review is set on asthma and type I allergy associated with pregnancy.,0
"In vitro diagnostic tools such as serological testing, for example, radioallergosorbent test for type I allergy or the lymphocyte transformation test for type IV allergy [49] are preferred to in vivo testing.",0
"Although not contraindicated, skin prick testing should be postponed until after birth because of possible, although rare, anaphylactic reactions to skin prick testing.",0
Pregnancy itself may also affect the course of asthma and related diseases.,0
Only in situations where in vitro diagnosis is not conclusive and the mother is at risk for developing allergy symptoms should in vivo skin tests be used.,0
"Importantly, when performing in vivo testing such as skin tests or provocation test, the exceptional immunologic status accompanying pregnancy should be considered when interpreting test results.",0
Any unexpected test result and any symptoms that change over time should be reevaluated after pregnancy.,0
"In addition, the attending physician should bear in mind that some symptoms may be a direct result of pregnancy and not allergy related, for example, vasomotor rhinitis in the last trimester [51] and gestational urticaria (pruritic urticarial papules and plaques in pregnancy) [52].",0
"Nonpharmacological Management of Allergic Diseases During Pregnancy\nMothers with diagnosed allergy should avoid exposure to and contact with specific allergens (including food allergens) and should especially avoid the inhalation of potent triggers for asthma, such as animal dander, house dust, tobacco smoke, and irritating pollutants [22].",0
"Hyposensitization (immunotherapy), which may be selectively indicated in certain patients with AR, bee venom sensitivity, and asthma should not be initiated during pregnancy because of the risk of systemic reactions.",0
"For patients who were already on immunotherapy before the pregnancy, maintenance treatment may be continued safely during pregnancy.",0
"However, the allergen dose should not be increased during pregnancy but rather reduced if necessary [29].",0
Cross-linking is more likely if the allergen occurs in dimerized or multimerized form [3].,0
Immunotherapy may be continued as maintenance treatment but should not be initiated during pregnancy.,0
Part 2: Prevention of Asthma and Allergies in Early Life\n\nInfants With High-Risk of Allergy\nThe potential risk for the development of atopy among newborns is high.,0
Genetic components and complex environmental factors contribute to the etiology of asthma and atopic diseases.,0
"To date, there are no biomarkers that can reliably predict which newborn will develop atopy.",0
Immediate-phase type I allergic symptoms usually occur within several minutes after allergen contact.,0
"However, an atopic family history has been recognized to be a simple and inexpensive risk indicator.",0
"The degree of risk seems to be directly related to the family history of allergy and especially to maternal atopy,[53] particularly when the mother has diagnosed atopic eczema and has elevated IgE levels.",0
"The influence of maternal sensitization on the immune response of newborns was recently shown in a human observational study of AR, in which only the organ-specific symptoms of the mother but not the father were demonstrated to be relevant for the imprinting of the child [55].",0
"However, sensitization may not be restricted to the organ at which the mother experiences allergic symptoms because asthma or wheezing in children was associated not only with asthma and AR, but also with eczema or any allergic disease in their parents and siblings [56,57].",0
"The newly synthesized cytokines and chemokines lead to the late-phase reaction associated with tissue edema by recruitment and activation of additional inflammatory cells, including basophils, eosinophils, and T helper type 2 (Th2) lymphocytes [6].",0
Transfer Mechanisms of Allergy (Immunopathogenesis of Atopy)\nThe allergic status of the mother can potentially affect the immune response of the offspring through numerous factors that are transferable via the placenta or breast milk.,0
The direct transfer of food or inhalant allergens via the placenta or breast milk has long been recognized [58-60].,0
"In addition, antibodies can be transferred to the child via placenta (IgG, IgA) or breast milk (IgA, IgG, IgM, IgE),[61,62] and even a transamniotic transfer of intact maternal IgE into the amniotic fluid can occur [63].",0
Only a very limited number of human studies on the maternofetal transfer of cytokines and chemokines are available.,0
The transfer of maternal cytokines was confirmed in a study of suckling piglets [65].,0
In vivo and in vitro models have shown that such transfer may lead to reduced neonatal immunity.,0
"Also chemokines, for example, IL-8, a cytokine that is regulated on activation with normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), IFN-Î³ -inducible protein 10, and monokine induced by IFN-Î³ have been detected in breast milk [66,67].",0
"However, cytokines and other soluble inflammation markers are found in breast milk from atopic as well as in nonatopic women.",0
"Another factor that should be considered is the composition of fatty acids present in breast milk, which may influence the immune response of the child [68].",0
"Other allergic diseases that may complicate pregnancy include conjunctivitis, acute urticaria, anaphylaxis, food allergy, and drug allergy.",0
This seems to be important because allergen-specific T cells transferred from 1 mouse mother to another can transmit asthma risk to the offspring of the recipient mouse mother [69].,0
Trafficking of cells could therefore be responsible for the passing of allergy risk from mother to fetus.,0
Environmental Risk Factors for Atopy\nThe causes of allergy in general and of specific sensitization in newborns in particular have not yet been completely determined.,0
"Besides the role of genetic predisposition, some factors have been identified that may either contribute to sensitization of the mother and to the subsequent transfer of a predisposition for allergy to the offspring, or that directly induce sensitization in offspring that manifests shortly after birth or at a young age.",0
Asthma and allergic disorders can affect the course and outcome of the pregnancy.,0
Exposure to Tobacco Smoke\nOne of the most frequently discussed risk factors for induction of sensitization in all populations and age groups is tobacco smoke (active smoking or the passive environmental exposure).,0
"In a recent mouse study, exposure to smoke in utero induced a higher risk of sensitization against allergens in adult age in the offspring [70].",0
"Accordingly, in human blood samples, Th2 cytokines responsible for a predisposition toward allergy were elevated in the neonates only of mothers who had smoked during pregnancy [71].",0
"Alarmingly, in the birth cohort study from the Isle of Wight, about 43% of children had been exposed to environmental tobacco smoke during their first year of life [38].",0
Alcohol Consumption\nAlcohol consumption by the mother during pregnancy is associated with higher total IgE levels in cord blood [76].,0
Maternal Diet\nThe maternal dietary component consumed during gestation could influence the immune status of the child.,0
"For instance, different polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been shown to differently influence the outcome of eczema in the child.",0
"A diet higher in n-6 PUFAs--as present, for example, in margarine and vegetable oils--seems to be more likely to induce eczema than n-3 PUFAs, which are for instance found in fish [79].",0
"Accordingly, another study showed that fish consumption decreased eczema [80].",0
"However, it may not be the absolute content but the ratio of n-6 to n-3 PUFAs that may influence the development of either tolerance or sensitization to food, as a high ratio of 9 of n-6/n-3 in the diet of the mother prevented the induction of oral tolerance to ovalbumin in the offspring in a rat study [81].",0
"Celery and citrus fruits seem to increase the risk of food sensitization, whereas vegetable oils, raw sweet pepper, and again citrus fruit increase sensitization to respiratory antigens [79].",0
"Interestingly, apples consumed during pregnancy were able to decrease wheezing in children [80].",0
"According to a directive of the Commission of European Communities from 2005, the most allergenic foods have to be labeled because of their potency of eliciting severe allergic reactions: these are crustacean, fish, nuts, milk, egg, wheat/gluten, peanuts, soy, sesame, mustard, and celery.",0
Pregnancy itself may also affect the course of asthma and other diseases [10].,0
It has long been proposed that the mother should avoid such foods containing potential allergens during pregnancy and lactation to prevent food sensitization in the child.,0
"However, recent studies suggest that allergen exposure may be necessary to induce tolerance, and moreover, a balanced diet prevents malnutrition of both mother and child [82].",0
"Furthermore, alterations of the maternal diet, that is, avoidance of milk and egg consumption during pregnancy did not seem to lower the risk of sensitization in the child [83,84].",0
"Studies found that about 70% of pregnant women are affected by these symptoms during their last trimenon,[85] and 50% of them are likely to take acid-suppressing medication.",0
"However, recent animal and human studies indicate that acid suppression and the resulting elevated pH in the stomach may lead to an increased risk of sensitization to food [86,87].",0
This sensitization of the mother was shown to lead to an increased risk of food allergy in the newborn in a BALB/c mouse model [39].,0
Optimal management of these disorders during pregnancy is vital to ensure the welfare of the mother and the baby.,0
"As previously discussed, an allergic status of the mother has the potency to affect the immune response of the offspring by numerous factors transferable via placenta or breast milk and even via the transamniotic route, for instance, intact maternal IgE in amniotic fluid, maternal DNA in cord blood, leukocytes, and chemokines such as IL-8, RANTES, interferon-Î³-inducible protein 10, or monokine induced by IFN-Î³, allergens, as well as antibodies.",0
"Furthermore, the offspring of sensitized mothers are prone to experience suppression and a later onset of normal levels of the Th1 cytokine IFN-Î³ because of a lower frequency of IFN-Î³-producing cells, and therefore a further bias toward a Th2 immune response.",0
"[""Infant's Diet\nRegarding the nutrition of the baby, reduced breast-feeding and early introduction of solid food have been discussed as confounders to allergy development.""]",0
"However, a randomized trial revealed quite contrary that promoted and prolonged (exclusive) breast-feeding is not able to prevent development of allergy or asthma in children at the age of about 6 years [88].",0
"In addition, a systematic review of several studies found no clear negative association between early solid food introduction and the development of asthma, food allergy, AR, or animal dander allergy [89].",0
Specific pharmacological agents for treatment of asthma or allergic diseases must be cautiously selected.,0
"The impact of these 2 factors for sensitization to other allergens, such as aeroallergens, has not been investigated.",0
"However, 1 study showed that adolescents who had been born prematurely had a substantially decreased expiratory volume and increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness, making them potential candidates for developing asthma [91].",0
"Birth by Cesarean Delivery\nThe delivery of a baby by cesarean delivery has been suggested to be associated with increased risk of allergies and atopic diseases in the child, most probably because of a lower bacterial exposure for the child.",0
"In a recent population-based cohort study in Norway, it was shown that a positive association exists for cesarean delivery and risk of asthma in the child (especially when the cesarean delivery was performed because of an emergency in contrast to a planned section) [92].",0
"Bager and colleagues [93,94] also showed an increased risk for asthma, allergic rhinitis, and possibly for food allergies in their meta-analysis.",0
"However, because of the low numbers of an allergic outcome associated to cesarean delivery (only 1%-4%), the authors concluded that the epidemic increase of allergic diseases might not be attributable to the increased numbers of cesarean delivery.",0
Insufficient Exposure to Environmental Bacteria\nThe hygiene hypothesis states that low exposure of the mother during pregnancy and of the newborn in early life to environmental bacteria contributes to a Th2-biased immune response.,0
This hypothesis has been confirmed by several experimental animal and epidemiological human studies (reviewed in Renz et al [95]).,0
"Preventive Measures for Mother and Child\nStrategies for prevention of atopic diseases may be categorized as primary, secondary, and tertiary.",0
Primary prevention has been suggested for those newborns who have at least 1 parent or sibling with proven atopy.,0
"However, it must be borne in mind that a proportion of children who develop atopic manifestations in the first years of life come from families in which neither parents nor siblings are atopic.",0
"This suggests the possibility that some infants who would never have developed atopy would undergo preventive regimens, whereas others who become symptomatic in early life would not have received adequate advice.",0
Preventive pharmacotherapy and immunotherapy will not be discussed.,0
Smoking\nMaternal smoking and passive exposure to smoke should both be avoided.,0
"This is especially important for pregnant asthmatic patients, in whom smoking-related morbidity is independent of--and adds to--the morbidity resulting from asthma [96].",0
"Although there are contradicting epidemiological and experimental results regarding the direct influence of smoking on total and specific IgE production,[97,98] smoking should nevertheless be avoided for obvious reasons, such as carcinogenic smoke constituents and the vasoconstrictive effect of nicotine.",0
Alcohol\nAlcohol intake should be avoided by the pregnant mother because of well-known toxic effects on both mother and fetus.,0
"Moreover, alcohol consumption has been shown to induce higher IgE levels against aeroallergens in atopic patients [76].",0
"[""Maternal Diet During Pregnancy\nA Cochrane database meta-analysis of 4 clinical studies concluded that antigen avoidance during pregnancy is unlikely to reduce the child's risk of developing atopic disease, and dietary restrictions could adversely affect maternal or fetal nutrition [99].""]",0
"Although previously suggested that pregnant women with risks avoid peanuts, a subsequent study found no evidence of prenatal sensitization from maternal consumption of peanuts [100].",0
"In addition, recent publications revealed that an effect (positive or negative) of peanut avoidance on sensitization was not detectable (although too few valuable subjects and the observational nature of the reports reduce the ability to make firm conclusions) [101,102].",0
"Generally, there is a lack of evidence for maternal pregnancy restriction diets.",0
"Additional recent studies about pregnancy diets reveal that components other than specific allergens, such as fat, may influence atopy outcomes [103,104].",0
"However, the reality is that medications must be considered for pregnant patients with medical disorders, based on a thorough appreciation of the potential deleterious effects of untreated disease.",0
"Therefore, no special diet for the mother is required during pregnancy.",0
"On the contrary, the diet should be well balanced and consist of as many different nutrients as possible, as the current literature suggests that antigens obtained via the oral route during pregnancy and lactation are needed to develop allergen tolerance in the child [105].",0
"In line with this, there was no association between maternal intake of foods during pregnancy and the occurrence of asthma, respiratory disease, or allergy in 5-year-old children [80].",0
"Furthermore, many studies found no benefit of a restricted diet avoiding the consumption of allergy-inducing food during pregnancy [82].",0
"However, if the mother is already allergic or if there is a family history of atopy or allergy, food comprising potential allergens should be avoided.",0
"In such instances, the avoidance of peanuts, nuts, fish, eggs, and sesame during the last 3 months of pregnancy may have a protective effect [106].",0
"In this respect, government recommendations must be carefully worded, as 1 study found that avoidance of peanuts was overdone among pregnant women: although such avoidance was recommended only for women with atopy risk, 65% of all pregnant women had avoided peanuts during pregnancy (42% of all women who responded had heard about the advice, eg, from their midwives, and 50% subsequently changed their diet) [101].",0
"Numerous individual nutrients consumed by the mother during pregnancy have been suggested as being preventive for development of atopic diseases in the child; these include apples or fish,[80] vitamin D,[107] vitamin E,[108] and various probiotics, the latter having been shown to be effective in mouse models [109] and human studies [110].",0
"Antiacids During Pregnancy\nRecent studies have indicated that acid-suppressing medications can promote sensitization in adults [86,87].",0
"Therefore, it is suggested that antiacids should be taken only when prescribed by an attending physician to the childbearing mother.",0
"Treatment of reflux during pregnancy should focus on nonpharmacological measures, such as avoiding large meals shortly before bedtime, sleeping with the upper body elevated, and avoiding extensive consumption of coffee, sweets, and fatty foods.",0
"In addition, smoking is a cause of reflux and should be avoided.",0
"If these measures are unsuccessful, then prescription of antiacid drugs should be considered, for example, in the form of a step-up program beginning with antacids, and in case of failure with histamine-2 receptor antagonists, whereas proton pump inhibitors should only be used in women with intractable symptoms or complicated reflux disease [111,112].",0
"For instance, women with asthma or allergic diseases require drug therapy during pregnancy to prevent symptoms severe enough to be life threatening to the mother or the fetus (eg, severe acute asthma that can result in hypoxia).",0
"Avoidance of Other Allergens During Pregnancy\nAvoidance of other allergens is necessary only if the pregnant patients are already sensitized (eg, to cats, dogs, horses, or house dust).",0
"However, allergen avoidance may not be preventive or practical in all cohorts [113].",0
A previous expert review that was not a structured meta-analysis and did not exclude as many studies as the Cochrane review concluded that special maternal lactation avoidance diets were unnecessary [114].,0
"During lactation, a special diet for the mother (or, if not breast-feeding, hypoallergenic formula nutrition for the infant) should be considered only in individuals with an established atopy risk or existing allergy [82,115].",0
"Diet of the Infants\nAs mentioned previously, for breast-feeding, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether it is more protective against allergies and asthma than bottle feeding because in a recent study, prolonged and exclusive breast-feeding could not decrease the rate of allergies or asthma in children [88].",0
"[""Furthermore, there are data supporting that breast-feeding should not be continued beyond 9 months of age because doing so seems to increase the child's risk for atopic diseases, such as atopic dermatitis and food hypersensitivity [116].""]",0
Some studies investigated the effect of reduced exposure of infants to allergen-provoking food.,0
"In cases where a reduced sensitization to food was found, this protective effect was short-lived and was primarily observed during the first year of life.",0
"Of the available medications for allergic rhinitis (AR), chlorpheniramine is recommended as the first-generation antihistamine of choice for use during pregnancy [11].",0
"[""As a further preventive measure, the early introduction of solid food (ie, baby food from jars and table food) into the infant's diet has to be revisited.""]",0
"It has been suggested that foods containing allergy-provoking proteins such as milk, egg, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and seafood should not be introduced into the diet of the child before the age of 6 months to 3 years [117].",0
"However, contact with and exposure to antigens may be necessary in early life to develop tolerance in the immune system [118].",0
"Thus far, studies on delayed introduction of solids led to conflicting results.",0
"Summary\nBased on currently available evidence, guidelines for primary and secondary prevention of allergic disease can be summarized as follows (Table3).",0
"Caption (TABLE-WRAP): TABLE 3\n\nPrimary Prevention of Asthma and Allergies in Early LifePreventive Measures \u2003Smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke should be avoided, especially during pregnancy and early childhood\u2003Alcohol consumption should be avoided by the mother during pregnancy and lactation\u2003Damp housing conditions should be avoided and indoor air pollutants reduced, especially for high-risk children (history of atopy or allergy in a first-degree relative)\u2003Breast-feeding should be performed exclusively until 6 months with no special diet for the lactating mother (except when the mother is already diagnosed with food allergy)\u2003Nonprescription drugs should be avoided during pregnancy and lactation unless recommended by a physician\n\nSmoking and Alcohol\nSmoking and passive exposure to cigarette smoke as well as alcohol consumption should be strictly avoided.",0
"Based on the information available (Table1), loratadine or cetirizine may be considered the second-generation antihistamines of choice.",0
"Diet\nThere should be no special diet for the mother during pregnancy and lactation, unless the mother or child has a diagnosed food sensitization.",0
"[""In infants with risk of allergy, introduction of solid foods in general should be postponed until 6 months of age, milk products until 12 months, hen's egg until 24 months, and peanut, tree nuts, fish, and seafood until at least 36 months.""]",0
"Other Allergens\nAvoidance of allergens (pets, house dust, contact allergens, drugs) is not recommended except when sensitization has already been diagnosed.",0
Reflux Treatment\nPregnancy-associated reflux should be treated by nonpharmacological measures first.,0
"Atopy\nFor newborns at suspected risk for atopy, that is, with a history of atopy/allergy in a first-degree relative (parents, siblings), exposure to irritating air pollutants and airborne allergens such as molds should be minimized.",0
Breast-feeding\nInfants should be breast-fed for at least 4 months but no longer than 9 months.,0
"Special hypoallergenic formula (extensively hydrolyzed, not soy-based) should be used only if the child is diagnosed with atopy.",0
"Drugs\nAll nonprescription drugs (eg, antiacids) should be avoided during pregnancy and lactation unless recommended by a physician; patients should avoid intake of any medication including over-the-counter substances without consulting their physicians.",0
The decision whether to use a first-generation or second-generation antihistamine for a particular patient must be individualized.,0
"Caption (TABLE-WRAP): TABLE 1\n\nRecommendations for Treatment of Asthma and Allergies in PregnancyDrugs preferred for use during pregnancy\u2003Anti-inflammatory: cromolyn beclomethasone, prednisone\u2003Bronchodilator: inhaled Î²2-adrenergic agonist, theophylline\u2003Antihistamine: chlorpheniramine, tripelennamine\u2003Decongestant: pseudoephedrine, oxymetazoline\u2003Cough: guaifenesin, dextromethorphan\u2003Antibiotic: amoxicillinDrugs that generally should be avoided during pregnancy\u2003Î±-Adrenergic compounds (other than pseudoephedrine)\u2003Epinephrine (other than for anaphylaxis)\u2003Iodides\u2003Sulfonamides (in late pregnancy)\u2003Tetracyclines\u2003Quinolones\nAdapted from the NAEPP expert group report [21].",0
This information is critical for the design of future intervention trials targeting obesity prevention in children.,0
"The primary aim of this study was to examine the impact of GWG, maternal eating and exercise behaviors, and psychosocial factors on offspring weight status.",0
"We hypothesized that offspring exposed to maternal obesity, excessive GWG, poor prenatal eating habits, less exercise in pregnancy, and greater maternal psychosocial distress during gestation would have higher weight for age (WFA) z -scores at birth and 6 months than nonexposed counterparts.",0
"Studies have consistently found that higher maternal weight entering and during pregnancy increases risk for obesity among offspring in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood [1,2].",0
"While shared genes account for some of the similarity in maternal and offspring weight, evidence suggests that exposure to the uterine environment of an obese woman itself may directly program offspring obesity [3].",0
"In the USA excessive GWG remains of predominant concern, as 60% of obese women gain more than recommended.",0
Some evidence suggests that maternal prenatal intake of protein and fat [7â€“9] may be positively associated with birth weight.,0
Only lower maternal fat intake (âˆ’0.22; P = 0.01) and trend for higher carbohydrate intake (0.16; P = 0.06) early in pregnancy were correlated with higher WFA z -scores at 6 months.,0
"Discussion\nThis is one of the few studies to prospectively and simultaneously examine the impact of dietary, physical activity, and psychosocial parameters during pregnancy on the offspring weight status of overweight/obese and normal weight mothers.",0
"Studies of protein intake in pregnancy have indicated that higher maternal protein intake was positively associated with birth weight [8,9], but there are notable exceptions [34,35] and most studies assessed diet later in gestation.",0
"Although a recent pilot randomized trial [39] found no significant impact of a low glycemic index diet on the offspring weight of overweight/obese mothers, future, larger randomized trials and research with more frequent assessments of diet in pregnancy are needed to untangle the relationship between weight status, time in pregnancy of nutrient exposures, and offspring weight outcomes.",0
"Also, increasing physical activity during pregnancy has been related to lower GWG in some [41] but not all [42] observational studies.",0
"Overall, findings from the current study support a stronger role for maternal intake than expenditure in predicting offspring weight outcomes, but additional studies with objective measures of physical activity (e.g., accelerometry) are clearly needed.",0
"Increases in stress were related to lower offspring weight status in normal weight mothers (adjusted analyses) and overweight/obese mothers (unadjusted analyses), which is consistent with earlier research on stress in relation to inadequate GWG [45] and long-term offspring health [46].",0
"[""Overall, however, the current study's findings suggest that dietary variables may exert more of an effect than maternal psychosocial variables on offspring weight outcomes.""]",0
"Women ( n = 32) who developed gestational diabetes (GDM) were excluded from analysis a priori, given potential impact of GDM on both offspring and maternal weight gain [18].",0
"Birth weight is an independent predictor of the development of obesity; however, increases in weight during the first 3â€“6 months of life are also influential on long-term increased risk of obesity [47,48].",0
Future research is needed to determine whether differences in postnatal feeding behaviors might explain differential growth rates in offspring of normal weight and overweight/obese mothers.,0
"[""This study's focus was on predictors of large for gestational age at birth and 6 months, but future research is needed to examine predictors of small for gestational age, which may also predispose offspring to increased fat mass and incidence of metabolic syndrome as children and adults [53].""]",0
"[""Overweight/Obese Mothers\nIn initial unadjusted analyses, several significant associations between overweight/obese mothers' prenatal behaviors and offspring WFA z -scores were observed (Table 2).""]",0
"Similarly, greater consumption of sweets early in pregnancy was significantly related to higher odds of macrosomia (OR = 1.1 (1.0, 1.2); P =\u2009\u20090.004) and WFA >90th percentile at birth (OR = 1.2 (1.1, 1.3); P =\u2009\u20090.002).",0
"Maternal Behaviors during Pregnancy Impact Offspring Obesity Risk\n\nAbstract\nThis study investigated the effects of maternal changes during pregnancy in diet, exercise, and psychosocial factors on offspring weight parameters at birth and 6 months.",0
"[""Mothers' eating behaviors during pregnancy, especially intake of sweets in OW/OB mothers, may have a lasting effect on child weight.""]",0
We examined GWG as an independent predictor and potential mediator of effects of maternal prenatal behaviors on offspring weight outcomes (Table 3).,0
"Examining GWG as a potential mediator, the effects of maternal prenatal behaviors on offspring weight outcomes were generally attenuated (i.e., P value increases between 0.01 and 0.06 across analyses) but not entirely removed when GWG was included in the models (Table 3).",0
"Normal Weight Mothers\nIn initial, unadjusted analyses, few significant correlations were found between prenatal behaviors and WFA z -scores at birth and 6 months in the offspring of normal weight mothers.",0
"Decreases in perceived stress during pregnancy were also independently related to higher odds of WFA >90th percentile (OR = 1.5 (1.1, 2.0); P =\u2009\u2009.01) but did not independently predict WFA z -scores at 6 months.",0
We also examined GWG as an independent predictor and potential mediator of effects of maternal prenatal behaviors on weight outcomes (Table 4).,0
"Introduction\nRisk of obesity is shaped, in large part, by early life events starting during gestation.",0
"Examining GWG as a potential mediator, the effects of maternal prenatal behaviors on offspring weight outcomes were generally attenuated (Table 4).",0
"In obese mothers, we found that higher intake of sweets early in pregnancy was related to higher offspring weight status at birth and 6 months.",0
No prior studies have specifically examined impacts of maternal intake of sweets or soft drinks in pregnancy on offspring weight parameters.,0
"Our findings are consistent with some studies in nonpregnant adults and children showing a connection between higher intake of sweets and soft drinks and increased weight status [32], but conflicting results have been reported in association with GWG [33].",0
"Overall, the current study extends existing work by suggesting that exposure to foods or drinks high in sugar content early in gestation may predispose offspring to higher weight status early in infancy, independent of maternal GWG.",0
"In obese mothers, lower protein intake early in pregnancy and increased protein intakes over the course of the pregnancy were independently related to higher offspring weight at 6 months.",0
"Inverse associations between fat intake early in pregnancy and offspring weight have been reported previously [36], but not consistently [37].",0
"Nutritional effects on the fetus and mother may vary with prepregnancy body weight, trimester of exposure during pregnancy, and overall balance of macronutrients [8,38].",0
"Surprisingly, physical activity and television viewing were not significantly related to offspring weight outcomes in normal weight or overweight/obese mothers.",0
"Few clinical trial intervention studies have specifically measured changes in physical activity during pregnancy, but available evidence suggests little to no effect on maternal GWG [16,43].",0
Other research has found that a reduction in physical activity by bed rest was associated with an increase in infant birth weight [44].,0
Excessive GWG was related to offspring weight but more strongly at birth than at 6 months and was not significantly related to changes in WFA z -scores.,0
"The association between GWG and offspring overweight may decrease as children grow older [49,50].",0
"Similarly, maternal prenatal behaviors may differentially impact birth and 6 months offspring weights (e.g., protein impacting 6 month but not birth weight in the current study).",0
"Interestingly, adjustment for GWG attenuated but generally did not completely remove the impact of dietary variables on offspring weight, particularly at 6 months.",0
This suggests that dietary exposures may impact offspring weight status above and beyond the potential influence of excessive GWG.,0
"Future research with more frequent assessments of offspring weight and, potentially, analysis of growth velocities [51] might better inform how and when nutrient exposures in pregnancy impact growth.",0
"This study is one of the first to prospectively examine impacts of prenatal diet, physical activity, and psychosocial exposures on offspring weight outcomes in a diverse sample.",0
"The sample was diverse but self-selected and free of diseases that might contraindicate participation in a lifestyle intervention study; thus, findings may not generalize to the population at large.",0
"A self-report, food frequency questionnaire was used, which is useful in ranking nutrient intakes of individual subjects but can be subject to bias, particularly in obese individuals [52].",0
Both excessive [4] and inadequate [5] weight gain in the mother during gestation have been shown to lead to overly rapid fetal and infant growth rates and the programming of future risk of childhood overweight and metabolic disease.,0
"[""Conclusions\nFindings from the current study indicate that excessive GWG and mothers' eating behaviors during pregnancy, especially intake of sweets in overweight/obese mothers, may influence offspring weight status early in infancy.""]",0
More research with larger sample sizes and frequent assessments of diet is needed to inform the impact of timing of nutrient exposures on offspring weight status.,0
"Also, future adequately powered randomized clinical trials are needed to determine whether modifying maternal prenatal behaviors and GWG can prevent offspring obesity.",0
"Identifying modifiable, prenatal causes of childhood obesity will inform future interventions targeting pregnancy as a â€œteachable momentâ€ for primary and secondary obesity prevention.",0
"Although maternal obesity and excessive GWG are both the result of energy intake exceeding energy expenditure, few studies have examined the specific influences of maternal dietary and exercise behaviors during pregnancy on offspring obesity risk.",0
"In animal models, prenatal exposures to overnutrition, high-fat and high-protein diets, â€œjunkâ€ food, and stress have been linked with greater adiposity in offspring [10â€“12].",0
"In nonpregnant humans, intake of soft drinks and junk food [13], higher dietary disinhibition [14], and restrictive dieting practices [15] have been positively correlated with overweight in children.",0
"However, little research has comprehensively examined the impact of maternal prenatal behaviors and psychosocial variables measured during pregnancy on subsequent offspring weight status at birth and 6 months.",0
"However, thyroid cancer detected during pregnancy may cause anxiety about the optimal timing of recommended treatments and about both maternal and neonatal morbidity, as weel as pregnancy following a diagnosis of thyroid cancer obviously needs both maternal and foetal management.",0
"In addition, each situation must be considered in development, nothing is static, mainly in the first trimester.",0
"Finally, thyroid cancer patients often undergo total thyroidectomy and thus need adequate supplementation of both calcium and thyroxine.",0
"Thus, pregnancy following thyroid cancer needs both maternal and foetal control.",0
"The main problems are: i) to reach an adequate balance of maternal thyroid hormones that is absolutely required by the foetal central nervous system for normal maturation7, ii) to maintain maternal levels of l-thyroxin to avoid possible recurrence or spread of disease, and iii) to perform safe follow-up controls for the mother and to plan further therapy when needed.",0
"Thyroid hormones are major factors for the normal development of foetal brain, and until the end of the first trimester, when the hypothalamic-pituitary- thyroid axis becomes functional, the foetal brain is strictly dependent on local deiodination of maternal thyroxine7-12.",0
"Thyroid hormone deficiency may cause severe neurologic disorders, resulting from defects in neuronal cell differentiation and migration, axonal and dendritic outgrowth, myelin formation and synaptogenesis7913.",0
The offspring of women with a serum-free thyroxine (fT4) concentration in the lowest decile of the reference range at 12 weeks of gestation may have significant delays in neurodevelopment.,0
"[""During pregnancy, the mother's thyroid physiology undergoes many well-defined changes, leading to an increase in thyroid volume which is often associated with higher urinary iodine excretion.""]",0
It is also associated with the formation of new thyroid nodules with the histological features of nodular hyperplasia.,0
"Very early in pregnancy, the increase in oestrogen levels causes an approximate doubling in thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) that can lead to an increases in total T4 concentration and a reduced free fraction (Table I).",0
"In healthy women, the final effect consists of a significant increase in the total thyroxine pool, mainly in the first trimester17-19.",0
This increment may be brought about largely by thyroid stimulation induced by human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) through its structural affinity with thyrotropin (TSH).,0
"It can be observed that a slight increase in fT4 and a reduction in TSH occur between the 9thand 12thweeks of gestation; subsequently, HCG levels decrease and TSH reaches normal non-pregnant levels.",0
The TSH concentration generally lies within the normal range after the 16th to 18th week11171920.,0
"In hypothyroid or thyroidectomized pregnant women, such physiological changes obviously cannot occur.",0
"Both during suppressive or substitutive therapy, L-T4 requirement increases very early during pregnancy, reaching a plateau after 16thto 20thweeks of gestation, with a required L-T4 dosage approximately 30 to 50% higher than that administered before pregnancy.",0

"Finally, for thyroid cancer patients, hypothyroidism can rise the maternal risk of recurrence.",0
"Thus, hypothyroidism must be absolutely avoided in all pregnant woman, especially in thyroid cancer patients, and therefore correct supplementation of thyroxine is of extreme importance.",0
"Vitamin D requirement during pregnancy\nThyroidectomised patients often need calcium and D vitamin supplementation, and the treatment needs frequent adjustment during the pregnancy to prevent maternal and neonatal hypocalcemia.",0
During pregnancy vitamin D and calcium metabolism undergo significant changes to provide the calcium needed for maternal skeletal preservation and foetal skeletal formation.,0
"Increased intestinal calcium absorption seems to be the primary mechanism for obtaining extra calcium in physiological pregnancy, but frequent nausea and vomiting or sometimes diarrhea reduce the amount of calcium absorbed by the mother23.",0
"Moreover, the usual recommendations to avoid sun exposure reduces dermal synthesis of vitamin D3Although vitamin D is undoubtedly important for foetal bone development, we know that it plays a much wider role in health and disease prevention.",0
The main objectives in clinical monitoring of pregnant thyroid cancer patients are: 1) to reach an adequate balance of maternal calcium and thyroid hormones that is absolutely required by the foetal central nervous system for normal maturation; 2) to maintain optimal levels of maternal thyroxin to avoid possible recurrence or spread of disease; and 3) to perform safe follow-up visits for the mother and to plan further therapy when needed.,0
"Not really a vitamin, D3is a pro-prehormone made in the skin in response to ultraviolet-B light exposure.",0
"1,25(OH)2D may interfere with many functions beyond calcium metabolism, such as foetal ""imprinting"" that may affect neurodevelopment, immune function and chronic disease susceptibility later in life, as well as soon after birth2425.",0
"Vitamin D and calcium deficiency can lead to maternal anorexia with poor weight gain, and impaired bone ossification or osteopenia among newborn infant.. Neonatal hypocalcemia with seizures is not uncommon in D-vitamin deficient mothers.",0
"Vitamin D is likely safe during pregnancy and breast feeding when taken by mouth in recommended amounts, that is 10 mcg (400 USP units) of vitamin D daily in normal pregnancy.",0
but sometimes thyroidectomised women need more.,0
"Dosage in excess of 50 mcg (2000 units) per day are not recommended, thus the treatment of postsurgical hypoparatithyroid patient calcium supplementation may be required at dosage as high as 4 g/day together with D vitamin.",0
"The range between therapeutic and toxic doses is narrow, and vitamin D toxicity, when it occurs, is a serious problem.",0
"The first sign is a rise in the ratio of calcium to creatinine in the urine, which precedes hypercalcemia.",0
"Hypervitaminosis D is thought to be associated with a rare infant disease with supravalvular aortic stenosis, elfin facies and mental retardation.",0
"Thus doses of D vitamin and calcium supplementation, which may differ from those recommended in normal pregnancy, need to be carefully tailored in thyroidectomised patients.",0
Thyroid cancer and pregnancy\nTreatment and follow-up of thyroid cancer in pregnant women are the same as in non-pregnant patients except for the use of radioactive iodine.,0
"[""Data from a review of the literature and the authors' own experience show that in patients undergoing either suppressive or substitutive thyroxine therapy foetal thyroid growth is normal at ultrasound study, newborn thyroid status is normal, and the incidence of maternal morbidity is not influenced by the pregnancy.""]",0
"Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC) â€“ cancer arising from follicular thyroid cells\nMostly diagnosed in young people, DTC usually has a good prognosis with an overall 90-95% long-term disease-free survival for early stage or low risk tumours, which represent the vast majority of tumours diagnosed below 40-45 years of age.",0
"According to the current staging score, DTCs of any dimension, even with nodal invasion, for patients below 45 years of age, are classified as Stage I tumours, and usually pregnant patients are below 45 years of age.",0
Genetic alterations activating a common pathway of the RET-RAS-BRAF signalling cascade and other chromosomal rearrangements have been identified in most DTC.,0
"The existence of common genomic changes between DTC and anaplastic carcinoma may provide convincing proof of the multi-step carcinogenesis hypothesis in which cancer cells are produced from well-differentiated benign cells by transformation caused by accumulating damage to their genome\nAlthough gene expression in thyroid cancer reveals highly consistent profiles, a second hypothesis has been proposed, which can possibly explain other ""non-RET"" tumours: namely foetal cell carcinogenesis, according to which cancer cells are derived from the remnants of foetal thyroid cells, or from stem cells instead of differentiated follicular cells.",0
"Both hypotheses can be valid and coexist, and the second (foetal-cell carcinogenesis) could explain some cases of unusual, rapidly growing DTC.",0
"Both hypotheses would suggest a higher thyroid neoplasm proliferation in stimulated thyroid tissue during pregnancy or adolescence, though even in growing tissues these cancers show a very good prognosis.",0
The best treatment for nearly all identified malignant thyroid neoplasm is surgery.,0
Considerable controversy still exists over the optimal extent of primary surgical resection.,0
"In this review, the authors underline that regular adjustment of levo-thyroxine and calcium therapy is of outmost importance for both maternal and foetal well-being and offer some insight, very interesting from a practical point of view, to provide a clear and simple pathway for the management of pregnancy-associated thyroid cancer.",0
"As nodal spread is relatively common, initial surgical exploration should include careful examination of the central compartment nodes (paratracheal and tracheoesophageal) as well as dissection of clinically suspicious nodes for frozen section examination.",0
"Nodes in the jugular chains should also be carefully examined with US before surgery and, when suspicious, FNAB should be obtained.",0
"If nodal involvement is confirmed, total thyroidectomy and modified radical neck dissection are indicated.",0
Adjuvant therapies\nThyroid hormones â€“ Endocrine therapy: post-operative oral administration of supraphysiologic oral doses of levothyroxine are used assuming that the suppression of endogenous production of TSH deprives TSH-dependent DTC cells of an important growth-promoting influence and the goal for basal serum TSH should be in the 0.1 to 0.4 mIU/L range.,0
"Management and follow-up of thyroid cancer in pregnant women\n\nAbstractSUMMARY\nThyroid cancer, the most common endocrine malignancy, is often detected in young female patients.",0
"In conclusion, there are several ways to expedite the diagnosis of MTC and to follow-up patients after surgery: biochemical markers (e.g.",0
"This adjunctive therapy is supposed to destroy occult microscopic carcinoma within the thyroid remnant by being actively trapped both by normal and pathological thyroid cells, and to facilitate follow-up because serum thyroglobulin (HTG) measurements are more reliable after the destruction of residual normal thyroid tissue.",0
"Detecting a thyroid cancer during pregnancy should not be a reason for termination of pregnancy, and in the large majority of cases it does not require urgent surgery4.",0
"The extent of absorption is increased in fasting status and decreased if there is inadequate intestinal absorption, often caused by other drugs, such as ferrous sulphate.",0
"Conclusions\nWhen treating thyroid cancer in pregnancy, 3 factors should be considered:\nThe effect of cancer on pregnancy: No metastasis to placenta or foetus â€“ no IUGR.",0
"All patients should undergo neck ultrasound and serum assay for HTG, HTG antibodies, fT4 and TSH.",0
"For thyroidectomized high-risk, non-pregnant patients, I-131 scan is also indicated, and serum HTG measurements â€“ performed both with thyroxine deprivation or under rTSH (recombinant human TSH) stimulation â€“ is a useful and reliable marker of disease progression or persistence.",0
"In our experience, the best follow-up method to detect loco-regional recurrences is, without question, neck sonography, followed by a meticulous physical examination by experienced personnel and, when indicated, ultrasound-guided FNA to confirm clinical suspicion of neck recurrence41-45.",0
"Medullary Thyroid Cancer (MTC) â€“ cancer arising from parafollicular thyroid cells\nMedullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MTC) constitutes approximately 5-10% of thyroid cancers, although there are no precise figures for incidence and survival rates because of the large geographic variations, mainly due to its familial pattern.",0
"Although uncommon, MTC is interesting because of its biochemical and genetic features and clinical association, both in autosomal-dominant inherited syndromes with incomplete penetrance (MEN IIA and IIB), and in the non-MEN forms.",0
Familial cases account for about 30% of MTCs.,0
"First, patients with MTC should always be suspected of carrying the genetic form of the disease.",0
"Secondly, the possible presence of associated conditions, such as pheochromocytoma, should be recognized before submitting patients to thyroidectomy.",0
"Lastly, since the clinical behaviour of MTC is extremely variable, this tumour represents a true therapeutic challenge.",0
"MTC arises from C cells secreting calcitonin, a 32-amino acid peptide.",0
"Calcitonin is the most clinically useful biochemical marker for these tumours, and C cell hyperplasia represents a pre-cancerous stage.",0
"These neuroendocrine cells are believed to be of neural crest origin, thus having a separate lineage from the endoderm-derived follicular thyroid cells.",0
"[""For this reason, in addition to calcitonin-gene products, such as calcitonin CGRP (calcitonin-generelated- peptide) and C-CAP (katacalcin), MTC cells express several other biochemical markers that reflect the features of diffuse neuroendocrine system, implicated in the pathogenesis of the symptoms (flushing, diarrhoea, carcinoid syndrome or Cushing's syndrome) that may occur in patients with advanced disease.""]",0
"These cells can also produce prostaglandins and other neuroendocrine markers such as chromogranin A, sometimes used together with calcitonin and CEA in MTC patients during follow-up.",0
"When dealing with MTC, we should always bear in mind that these patients may be the index-case for one of the familial forms of the disease: presymptomatic screening of relatives of MTC patients enables early diagnosis of this malignancy.",0
"Early diagnosis rather than more extensive surgery may improve survival and reduce recurrences, mostly in the MEN IIB form of MTC, which is highly aggressive.",0
"In inherited forms, the initial germline mutation produces multiple foci of cells â€“ the so-called C-cell hyperplasia â€“ that are susceptible to tumour formation, and each MTC is the result of a second cell transformation in one of these susceptible clones.",0
"Primary MTC lesions become visible at echography as solid masses, often with calcifications.",0
"For these reasons, differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is one of the most common cancers in women in the reproductive age.",0
"Fine needle aspiration shows a mixture of round, polyhedral and spindle-shaped cells that may seem undifferentiated, and look like a variable amount of extra-cellular amyloid.",0
MTC is somewhat more aggressive than papillary or follicular carcinoma.,0
"It locally extends into lymph nodes and into the surrounding muscles and trachea, and may invade lymphatic and blood vessels and metastasize in lungs, bones and liver.",0
"Sporadic MTC tumours are often monolateral with a single localization, while familial forms are mostly bilateral and often multifocal or diffuse.",0
"For these reasons, total thyroidectomy appears to be the appropriate approach to MTC.",0
"Central neck and upper mediastinum clearance and, in addition, mono or bilateral node dissection (depending on the extent of nodal involvement) is also advisable.",0
"The most appropriate treatment for clinical N0 tumours is still a matter of debate, but most surgeons prefer prophylactic node dissection because MTC metastasize in regional lymph nodes at a very early stage.",0
Surgery is the only treatment which is considered potentially curative for metastatic or recurrent medullary carcinoma.,0
"Hence, thyroid cancer ranks among the most common cancers during pregnancy, with a prevalence of 3.6-14 per 100,000 live births, mirroring the its incidence1-4.",0
The role of radiotherapy is controversial as MTC is generally not believed to be radio-sensitive.,0
"Therapy with long-acting somatostatin analogues has been tested in metastatic disease, with some positive benefots in most patients.",0
No reliably effective chemotherapeutic regimen has been identified.,0
"New drugs with anti-angiogenetic, anti-tyrosine kinase and anti-VEGF effects are currently under observation.",0
"Furthermore, there are new therapeutic approaches under validation for advanced or recurrent disease46-48.",0
"Thyroid nodules in pregnancy are often misdiagnosed because of physiological thyroid increases during pregnancy, but clinical and ultrasound findings are sufficient to suspect malignancy.",0
"Skilled examiners and good quality images with grey-scale and power Doppler US seem more reliable than other techniques in detecting and differentiating malignant and benign solid thyroid nodules, especially for small lesions.",0
"Even during pregnancy, US guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) is the investigation of choice, thanks to its reliability and safety1926.",0
"Some data suggest the importance of growth factors (mainly TSH, but also HCG) in growth, progression and spread of papillary tumours.",0
"Papillary thyroid cancer is the most common histological type detected in pregnant women, and in most series 90% to 95% of thyroid carcinoma diagnosed are Stage I disease, with the majority found in the first trimester of pregnancy during the first antenatal visit.",0
"The predominance of papillary cancer may be an important factor favouring localized disease, as these cancers metastasize slowly, and mostly in the lymphatic system, whereas less common follicular cancers tend to spread via angio-invasion with a higher frequency of distant metastasis.",0
"Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) in young people generally has an excellent prognosis, and disease-free survival among women with DTC diagnosed during pregnancy may not differ from that in age-matched non-pregnant women with similar disease.",0
"Although thyroid cancer during pregnancy may have a faster growth2728since hormonal factors (mainly HCG) may accelerate tumour progression, the real impact of pregnancy seems to be minimal.",0
"In fact, the rates of recurrence or the disease-free period do not differ between pregnant and non-pregnant women affected by the same disease22729-32.",0
Hod et al.,0
"reported a single case of accelerated tumour growth during pregnancy, but this would appear to be an exception rather than the rule29.",0
"In a large retrospective study on 595 pregnancy-associated thyroid cancers, Yasmeen et al.",0
"detected no difference in outcome, disease-free survival and morbidity when compared to age-matched non-pregnant women2.",0
"Differently from what is observed in other pregnancy-associated cancers, no metastasis of DTC to placenta or foetus has been reported.",0
An association between thyroid cancer and parity or full-term pregnancy has been assessed in many studies without significant or conclusive results6.,0
"In vitro oestrogens have been shown to down-regulate the NIS (sodium iodide symporter) gene and promote the production of thyroglobulin (HTG), increasing HTG-gene expression via oestrogen receptors present in thyroid tissue, without stimulating rapid cell proliferation145.",0
"Pregnancyassociated immune tolerance, designed for foetal survival, might enhance disease progression.",0
"However, according to literature data and our own experience pregnancy after thyroid cancer has been shown to have no significant effect on morbidity, disease-free period or survival time.",0
Pregnant women with thyroid cancer have been shown to have favourable outcomes regardless of the timing of diagnosis13233.,0
"[""Guidelines for evaluation and treatment of thyroid cancer must consider the gestational age but also the patients' desires.""]",0
"This could support the hypothesis that sex hormones and, therefore, menstrual and reproductive events, may modify thyroid cancer risk in women6, although these associations â€“ which could indicate either a causal link or a surveillance bias â€“ may reflect an aetiology shared by both the above-mentioned factors and by thyroid cancer.",0
"The problem of pregnancy-associated thyroid cancer can affect three groups of patients:\n\nNew diagnosis\nPatients with no prior history of cancer, in whom a malignant thyroid nodule is suspected or diagnosed during pregnancy.",0
"For these patients, surgery could be safely performed during the mid-trimester or delayed until delivery without worsening prognosis3034.",0
"When surgery is planned during pregnancy, it is important to consider both gestational age and the type of general anaesthesia.",0
"Whenever possible, the operation should be performed during the second trimester or after delivery37.",0
"During the first trimester, which is the organogenesis period, general anaesthetic agents may have some teratogenic potential or may increase the risk of miscarriage.",0
"In the third trimester, surgery may induce premature labour.",0
"Physiological changes of pregnancy, such as increased heart rate and blood volume, may complicate general anaesthesia, and hypotension caused by vena cava compression of the uterus during a long period in the supine position may cause foetal hypoperfusion1.",0
"Postponing surgery to at least 6-7 months after diagnosis of DTC in the first trimester does not adversely affect prognosis; on the other hand, thyroidectomy can be safely performed in the second trimester of pregnancy or after delivery15.",0
Thyroxin therapy should be started immediately after surgery because untreated hypothyroidism may expose the mother to a higher risk of disease recurrence and may have an adverse effect on cognitive function and regular growth of the offspring.,0
Regular assessments of TSH and fT4 levels every 6/8 weeks during pregnancy and breast-feeding are required to ensure an adequate dose of levothyroxine.,0
"Follow-up may be carried out on a regular basis with ultrasound techniques and thyroglobulin assay, as in non-pregnant women.",0
"Radioiodine therapy, when needed, can be safely postponed until after breast- feeding.",0
"Whether women treated for thyroid cancer should become pregnant was once a matter of concern, but current evidence suggests that DTC should not discourage intended pregnancy, with the usual recommendation to postpone it to at least 6 months after radioiodine therapy.",0
"In spite of the theoretical proliferative stimulation caused by HCG and placental growth factors, published data indicate that there is no evidence that thyroid cancer can be influenced by pregnancy.",0
"In addition, follow-up studies have shown no significant increase in risk.",0
"Usually, patients are recommended to postpone pregnancy to 6-12 months after radioiodine (I-131) treatment to avoid a potentially higher risk of miscarriage in the first few months after radioiodine therapy and to allow time enough to exclude residual disease requiring further treatment41438.",0
"Miscarriages or premature birth have raised concern about the use of radioactive iodine in a childbearing age due to the known mutagenic effect of radiation and the theoretical possibility that it may affect germ cells, thereby causing genetic damage, congenital abnormalities and malignancy in offspring.",0
"Virtually any person treated with any dosage of I-131 is at potential risk, but experimental evidence in animals and follow-up studies in humans has failed to reveal any statistically significant effects of I-131 on chromosomal abnormalities, congenital malformation or childhood cancers.",0
"Among those children born from I-131 treated women, the authors found only one case of ventricular septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus223940.",0
"A possible increase in the rate of miscarriages has been reported to occur in the early period after therapy, but it remains uncertain whether abortion can be caused either by I-131 itself, by the thyroid autoimmunity often associated with disease or by the hypothyroid-hyperprolactinaemic status accompanying I-131 therapy.",0
"At present, consensus has been reached on the fact that radioiodine treatment of DTC does not affect pregnancy outcome and does not appear to be associated with any genetic risk, with the usual recommendation to delay pregnancy for 6-12 months after radioiodine exposure, even if there is no evidence that pregnancy before this period could lead to a less favourable outcome2238.",0
Management of these patients and providing evidencebased advice are obviously extremely difficult tasks.,0
"Patients with active DTC can be reassured that, as mentioned above, pregnancy itself does not appear to increase disease progression, and therefore a gap in treatment during pregnancy is not contraindicated.",0
"For patients with local recurrent disease, ultrasound controls by skilled hands is of outmost importance, both to help surgeons in selecting tissues for excision and to perform local therapy, such as alcoholization of small lesions.",0
"For patients with advanced disease, ultrasound control of tissue growth can help in therapeutic decisions, such as timing of surgery.",0
"Whenever possible, surgery should be carried out during the second trimester or after delivery, as for newly diagnosed thyroid cancer.",0
"This treatment has been widely used for more than 40 years, with the assumption that suppression of endogenous TSH deprives TSH-dependent DTC cells of the most important growth factor.",0
"Therefore, thyroxine therapy aims at suppressing pituitary secretion of TSH, as indicated by serum TSH levels below 0.05 mIU/L.",0
"In univariate analyses, thyroxine therapy apparently helps decrease cancer-related death rates among patients with PTC.",0
Many series have reported reduced rates of tumour recurrence both in PTC and in FTC.,0
Doses of L-thyroxine greater than 150/200 Î¼g (at least 2 Î¼g/kg/day) are usually needed to maintain maternal serum-free thyroxin concentrations within the upper third of the reference range and to suppress TSH levels.,0
"Usually the dosage needs to be increased as early as during the fifth week of gestation, and fT4 TSH monitoring is recommended every 6 weeks for adequate adjustment of dosage.",0
"After delivery, thyroxine dose can be gradually reduced to pre-pregnancy levels, while TSH levels should be constantly monitored1015.",0
"However, such a relation has not yet been confirmed.",0
"Patients with MTC whose tumours deriving from C cells are not TSH-dependent do not require suppressive therapy, but only thyroxine replacement therapy after surgery, and the dosages are the same as those used for hypothyroidism.",0
"Pregnancy status requires much more accuracy in assessing levothyroxine dosage to protect the foetus from maternal hypothyroidism because, as mentioned above, the mother is the only source of thyroid hormones for the embryo in the first trimester of pregnancy.",0
"Approximately 40-80% of the oral dose is absorbed, with peak serum levels measured within 2-4 hour, and the half-life of the administered dose is approximately 1 week.",0
"Therefore, during pregnancy, thyroxin and ferrous sulphate doses should be spaced by at least 4 hours.",0
"[""There is limited but still important placental transfer of maternal T4 to the foetus18, while placental type III deiodinase catalyzes the conversion of T4 to the more active form reverse-T3, which crosses the placental barrier, and to the less active 3,3'-diiodothyronine (T2), representing a homeostatic mechanism for maintaining T3production in the placenta when maternal serum T4concentrations are modified18.""]",0
"Frequent monitoring and adjustment of L-T4 dosages are very important because of large fluctuations of T4 metabolism during pregnancy; calcium and D vitamin supplementation, often indispensable, must be carefully tailored2324.",0
Pregnancy does not seem to be compromised by thyroid cancer.,0
The diagnosis of a tumour during pregnancy obviously causes anxiety about the optimal timing of recommended treatments and about both maternal and neonatal morbidity.,0
"The effect of pregnancy on cancer: In vitro accelerated cell growth, no effect seen in vivo .",0
"Survival and disease-free intervals identical in pregnant and non-pregnant women\nThe effects of management modalities on pregnancy outcome: No I-131, tailored therapy.",0
Critical monthly adjustment of levothyroxine therapy: maintain fT4 in the upper third of reference range.,0
"However, thyroid cancer in young people has generally an excellent prognosis, and survival among women with thyroid cancer diagnosed during pregnancy may not differ from that in age-matched non-pregnant women with similar disease.",0
"Pregnancy is a special situation in oncology: we need to control two patients at the same time, and both are vulnerable.",0
"In Utero Exposures, Infant Growth, and DNA Methylation of Repetitive Elements and Developmentally Related Genes in Human Placenta\n\nAbstract\nBackground: Fetal programming describes the theory linking environmental conditions during embryonic and fetal development with risk of diseases later in life.",0
"Objectives: We examined associations between in utero exposures, infant growth, and methylation of repetitive elements and gene-associated DNA in human term placenta tissue samples.",0
"Mean LINE-1 and AluYb8 methylation levels were also found to be weakly to moderately correlated, with a Pearson correlation of 0.29 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.20, 0.38].",0
"To examine whether â€œglobal methylationâ€ represented as an average of gene-associated methylation identified in a genomewide manner was associated with infant growth, we tested for an association between birth weight percentile and mean methylation across the 26,486 autosomal loci measured using the Illumina Infinium array in a subset of 184 placenta samples.",0
"Multiple linear regression, model-based clustering methods, and gene set enrichment analysis examined the association between birth weight percentile, demographic variables, and repetitive element methylation and gene-associated CpG locus methylation.",0
"To further evaluate the association between infant birth weight and repetitive element methylation identified in the univariate analyses, controlled for confounders, we used multiple linear regression.",0
"By clustering, we hoped to uncover biologically meaningful groups of CpG loci, with similar methylation patterns, which may share biological characteristics such as comparable functionality in certain developmental pathways or location in similar genomic regions.",0
There was an overall significant relationship between AluYb8 methylation and RPMM class methylation ( p = 0.01); no association was observed between LINE-1 and RPMM class methylation.,0
"When considering class-specific relationships, a positive association was noted between AluYb8 methylation and methylation of CpGs encompassing the low to intermediately methylated class 9 (Figure 1).",0
"Additionally, classes 7, 11, and 12 were marginally positively associated with AluYb8 methylation levels, with CpGs exhibiting low to intermediate methylation.",0
"There was also interclass variation in the frequency of CpGs association with PcG target genes, with classes 7 and 9 in particular having a much higher proportion than the others (Figure 2F).",0
"Results: LINE-1 and AluYb8 methylation levels were found to be significantly positively associated with birth weight percentile ( p = 0.01 and p< 0.0001, respectively) and were found to differ significantly among infants exposed to tobacco smoke and alcohol.",0
"Class 9, which was associated with AluYb8 methylation extent, contained a high proportion of CpG loci located within CGIs (81%) and whose genes are considered PcG target genes (32%).",0
"Motivated by the variation in sequence features (bioinformatic attributes) observed between RPMM-based classes, we next performed a bioinformatically informed clustering of CpG loci into classes, grouping CpGs according to their sequence context: presence within a CGI, LINE-1, LINE-2, Alu, or MIR element, or PcG target gene and proximity (â‰¤ 1,000 bases) to any TFBS.",0
There was an overall significant relationship between AluYb8 methylation extent and bioinformatically derived CpG class methylation ( p< 0.0001) but not between LINE-1 methylation and bioinformatically derived CpG class methylation.,0
"When considering class-specific relationships, there was a positive association between AluYb8 methylation levels and mean methylation across loci allocated within a PcG target gene and LINE-2 element and proximal to a TFBS (class PcG/LINE-2/TFBS) and loci located within a CGI and PcG target gene and proximal to a TFBS (class CpG/PcG/TFBS).",0
"To expand on the bioinformatically informed analysis, which suggested that methylation of CpG loci proximal to a TFBS were associated with AluYb8 methylation, we performed a GSEA using specific TFBS, obtained from the UCSC Genomes Browser.",0
"Only three TFBS genes were overrepresented among loci whose methylation was associated with LINE-1 methylation: MEF2 , TBX1 , and POU2F1 .",0
"For those overrepresented among loci associated with AluYb8 methylation, there were a number of developmentally related TFBS genes ( CUX1 , CHX10 , PAX4 , PPARG , TAL1/ITF2 heterodimer, HAND1 , MYOD, OCT), as well as those involved in cell processes ( ACTR3B , S8 ), gene expression ( NFE2L ), lipid/sterol homeostasis ( NR3C1 ), and immune modulation ( GATA1 ).",0
Increased placental AluYb8 methylation was positively associated with average methylation among CpG loci found in polycomb group target genes; developmentally related transcription factor binding sites were overrepresented for differentially methylated loci associated with both elements.,0
Only POU2F1 was found to be overrepresented among loci associated with both LINE-1 and AluYb8 methylation.,0
"Discussion\nIn this study, we have identified significant associations between infant growth, in utero exposures, and repetitive element methylation in placental tissue.",0
"Moreover, by examining the relationship between repetitive element DNA methylation and genomewide (array) gene-associated methylation, this work suggests potential epigenetic mechanisms underlying changes to placental function that may lead to altered fetal development and programming.",0
"Overall, AluYb8 had higher DNA methylation levels than did LINE-1, which may be due to the lower degree of C-to-T transition mutations owing to the younger age of AluYb8 elements (Choi et al.",0
"AluYb8 levels were found to marginally differ by infant sex, which is consistent with the previous literature in that repetitive element methylation markers in blood may vary by sex (Cash et al.",0
"We found that birth weight percentile levels increased by about 10 and 15 points, respectively, with a 10% increase in LINE-1 or AluYb8 methylation levels, suggesting a strong association of repetitive element methylation markers with fetal growth.",0
"However, because LINE-1 and AluYb8 methylation levels have a moderate correlation, it is possible that these two repetitive element methylation markers may explain both similar and different sources of variation in infant growth.",0
Our analysis of the relationship between the extent of methylation at these elements and genomewide gene-associated methylation was aimed to better characterize the similarities and differences in the potential functional importance of these markers.,0
"The approach to examining the relationship between repetitive element methylation and gene-associated methylation was not designed to assess specific loci or genes associated with LINE-1 or AluYb8 methylation, but rather to evaluate whether methylation of particular groups of CpG loci with like methylation patterns or similar bioinformatic attributes were coordinately associated with LINE-1 or AluYb8 methylation, because this could inform on the process responsible for the variation between the two.",0
"Conclusions: Our results suggest that repetitive element methylation markers, most notably AluYb8 methylation, may be susceptible to epigenetic alterations resulting from the intrauterine environment and play a critical role in mediating placenta function, and may ultimately inform on the developmental basis of health and disease.",0
"Based on our data-driven RPMM approach, we observed that AluYb8 methylation was significantly and positively correlated with methylation at CpG loci in an intermediately methylated class containing loci that were located predominantly within CGIs and associated with PcG target genes.",0
"This was further substantiated in our bioinformatically informed classification analysis, because we identified a significant association between AluYb8 methylation and methylation of a group of loci defined by their position in a CGI, PcG target gene, and a TFBS, as well CpGs defined by association with a PcG target gene and LINE-2 element and proximal to a TFBS.",0
"This is in contrast to a previous study involving 12 fetal cord blood samples, which reported a significant correlation between LINE-1 methylation and methylation of specific loci residing mostly in CGIs (Fryer et al.",0
"This disparity may reflect tissue-specific differences in these relationships, as well as the larger and therefore more precise nature of our examination.",0
"PcG targets are a family of developmentally related genes that can remodel chromatin and are responsible for silencing HOX genes, which are critical in embryonic development as well as potentially hundreds of other genes involved in cellular differentiation (Kirmizis et al.",0
"We observed that increasing AluYb8 methylation was associated with greater extents of methylation at CpG loci located in a PcG target, and thus a change in the extent of methylation of AluYb8 may represent an alteration in the methylation of these key loci important in tissue development and differentiation.",0
Both bioinformatically informed CpG classes that were significantly associated with AluYb8 methylation contained loci that are proximal to TFBSs.,0
"Upon further exploration through GSEA, we observed an overrepresentation of several TFBSs for transcription factors critical in development, cellular processes, immune modulation, lipid or sterol homeostasis, and gene expression near loci associated with AluYb8, as well as a few developmental and cellular proliferation pathways for LINE-1.",0
"Specifically, POU2F1 binding sites were overrepresented among loci associated with both LINE-1 and AluYb8 extent.",0
"This transcription factor plays a role in the control of a wide range of genes, including small nuclear RNAs, immunoglobulins, histone H2B, and the glucocorticoid receptor, and thus has a central role in controlling various functions, including those of immunomodulation and steroid homeostasis in the placenta (Schonemann et al.",0
"Taken together, these results suggest that alterations to LINE-1 or AluYb8 methylation may act as a marker for key changes to the extent of methylation at loci targeted by important transcription factors for normal development and placenta processes necessary for appropriate growth.",0
"When looking at each repetitive element methylation marker grouped by various in utero exposures, we found that mean AluYb8 methylation levels were significantly different by maternal tobacco use during pregnancy, similar to results from another group that found significantly different levels of cytosine methylation by smoking status (Moore et al.",0
"Furthermore, mean LINE-1 methylation levels were significantly different by maternal alcohol use during pregnancy; however, limited numbers may affect our precision, so this result should be confirmed in further analyses.",0
"This study was limited in its assessment of environmental exposures because of the low number of exposed individuals and low power, making this part of our analysis largely exploratory in nature.",0
"However, it will be increasingly important to examine, in larger studies, how additional specific exposures, such as lead as has been done by previous researchers (Pilsner et al.",0
"2009), during intrauterine development affect these epigenetic markers in a more quantitative way.",0
Although a few other studies have correlated array-based methylation levels with repetitive element methylation markers (Fryer et al.,0
The importance of environmental exposures during intrauterine development on health throughout the life course is now well recognized in the epidemiologic literature (Barker 2004).,0
"2011) and found at times good correlation between the two, our results indicate that array-based methylation level may not be a good predictive marker of repetitive element methylation level in human placenta tissue.",0
"Array-based mean methylation across the 26,486 CpG loci was not found to be associated with any of our in utero exposures, contrasting with our repetitive element methylation markers.",0
"Additionally, LINE1, AluYb8, and specific array-based methylation loci often interrogate different genetic regions; therefore, their methylation may have a differential genomic impact.",0
"Furthermore, the divergence of results observed between LINE-1 and AluYb8 reported throughout this work suggests that these repetitive element methylation markers are distinct measures and may not represent true, and potentially interchangeable, surrogates of â€œglobalâ€ methylation.",0
"Although we found that these repetitive element indicators are weakly to moderately correlated, they have their own unique distributions of methylation values, consistent with previous comparisons between LINE-1 and Alu methylation in normal blood (Jintaridth and Mutirangura 2010).",0
"In addition, it is believed that genomic location and sequence context play a crucial role in the maintenance or loss of DNA methylation in these regions.",0
"The molecular mechanisms that underlie these observations remain unclear, although recent work suggests that alterations to placental function may lead to altered fetal development and programming, likely playing a critical role in mediating these associations (Higgins et al.",0
"For example, research has suggested that Alu sequences often flank CGIs (Graff et al.",0
1997) and therefore may play a distinct role in both repetitive element and gene-directed methylation.,0
"Differences between these markers can most likely be explained by the unequal distributions of these sequences throughout the genome, owing in some part to the evolutionary age of these two retrotransposable elements (Zamudio and Bourcâ€™his 2010).",0
"This may therefore be affecting the number of these elements in the genome and the functional relevance of their methylation, particularly in the placenta.",0
"As our results suggest, distinct mechanisms and selective pressures are likely responsible for their alteration.",0
"Modest limitations of this study include the use of data from medical records, which may have reduced the quality of covariate data used in this study.",0
"This may have been especially relevant in our measurement of maternal tobacco, alcohol, and prenatal vitamin use and could have potentially introduced a bias toward the null.",0
"Additionally, because Rhode Island is a small state representing a small geographic area, recruiting participants from this state may affect the generalizability of our findings; however, because the Women and Infants Hospital performs > 85% of all obstetrical deliveries in Providence County (the largest population center in Rhode Island), we believe this limitation is compensated for to some extent by the lack of ascertainment bias in this population-based study.",0
"Conclusions\nOverall, we have demonstrated that altered methylation of repetitive elements in the placenta is associated with birth outcome and with specific environmental exposures encountered by the fetus.",0
"Of course, birth weight is likely a proxy for a complex interplay of underlying etiologic mechanisms and environmental factors that overall contribute to infant health at birth and beyond.",0
Our data also suggest that these alterations may reflect underlying functional epigenetic alterations to genes important in placental growth and development.,0
"Confirmation and expansion of these findings in additional populations, with additional environmental data and more comprehensive methylation profiles as well as studies of the mechanism of these alterations, will provide additional valuable insights into the epigenetic mechanisms controlling fetal growth.",0
These data also further the hypothesis that the intrauterine environment acting through epigenetic alteration of the placenta is a key mechanism to explain the developmental origins of health and disease and suggest that enhanced examinations of the importance of placental epigenetic variation in health outcomes should be undertaken.,0
Environmental insults in utero may lead to changes in epigenetic mechanisms potentially affecting fetal development.,0
"Throughout in utero development, the placenta, through the production of various enzymes and hormones, plays an important role in controlling growth and development through the transfer of nutrients and waste and in protecting the fetus from many xenobiotic insults (Robins et al.",0
Recent work has demonstrated that placental genetic and epigenetic profiles may possibly serve as markers (Filiberto et al.,0
"This is true both in the fetus itself and in the placenta, where changes to the appropriate methylation patterning have been linked to adverse placental morphology and birth outcomes (Serman et al.",0
"Studies examining the impact of environmental exposures on DNA methylation have often focused on the global extent of 5-methylcytosine, using various approaches (Einstein et al.",0
"2009), including the examination of repetitive elements as surrogate markers of global methylation (Choi et al.",0
"The methylation status of these elements may represent a passive dosimeter by being altered by various exposures, although differences in the underlying structure of these elements and the unclear function of methylation of these regions suggest that their alteration and their potential relevance need to be more carefully examined.",0
"Thus, in this study we examined how the intrauterine environment is related to the methylation status of LINE-1 and Alu regions (specifically LINE-1 and AluYb8 , respectively) in a functionally relevant fetal tissue, the placenta.",0
"Further, we aimed to explore whether alterations to the methylation of these regions are associated with methylation of gene-associated loci using a genomewide bioinformatic approach, in order to provide clues about the potential importance of these alterations.",0

We observed differential expression of genes related to lipid metabolism (e.g.,0
Due to the normal dietary conditions at juvenile and adult stages the alterations found here can be regarded as fetal nutritional programming.,0
"Our model indicates that gestational LP diets affected the hepatic expression profiles in an acute, short-term as well as in a delayed, long-term manner in LP offspring.",0
"Together with the observation that the offspring of both groups did not differ in bodyweight but in body composition and fat content [17], the data indicate that the activity of different genes led to different partitioning of nutrients among peripheral and visceral organs and tissues.",0
It has been shown that fetal growth retardation is accompanied by alterations in cell cycle regulating molecules at both transcriptome [25] and proteome level [26].,0
"However, longitudinal studies focussed on diet-dependent alterations of cell cycle regulators are scarce.",0
These regulations may indicate an impaired fetal growth performance due to the gestational low protein diet.,0
"Therefore, the down-regulation of cell cycle regulating pathways might lead to a lengthened cell cycle in LP fetuses and offspring [27] and cumulate in growth retardation in LP fetuses.",0
"Notably, at stage 1 dpn no regulation of a distinct pathway was found in LP offspring.",0
"Obviously, the increased mRNA expression of genes related to cell cycle regulators within developmental period I in LP offspring accounts for compensatory regulations regarding the lowered fetal weight due to the gestational diet.",0
"Within developmental period III, AP offspring showed a decreased expression of genes associated with Polo-like kinases, which is in line with the assumption that LP pigs have not terminated their growth at stage 188 dpn; in particular their liver has not attained a steady-state and that there is persistent functional demand towards cell proliferation potentially to respond to an elevated metabolic burden, including a higher turn over of lipids and ketone bodies.",0
"The expression level of NCAPG (non-structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) condensin I complex subunit G) was highlighted as strongly associated with fetal growth retardation [28,29].",0
According to recent studies NCAPG is important during mitotic cell division.,0
"[""Conclusions\nThe transcriptomic modulations point to persistent functional demand on the liver towards cell proliferation in the LP group but not in the AP group at identical nutritional conditions during postnatal life due to divergent 'programming' of the genome.""]",0
"These expression patterns suggest a dietary effect on cellular turn-over, which might be increased at early stages but decreased at adult stage in LP offspring.",0
"Therefore, a diet-dependent tissue remodelling might take place in LP offspring as observed previously [30].",0
"[""The 'mTOR signaling' acts as an important nutrient sensing pathway that controls protein synthesis in mammalian cells at the level of translation [31].""]",0
"[""Thus, 'mTOR signaling' is involved in regulating individual cell growth, growth performance, and developmental processes [33,34].""]",0
This may account for improper protein synthesis [35] in LP offspring.,0
"[""However, at adult stage a diet-dependent up-regulation of 'mTOR signaling' in LP offspring suggests a transcriptional priority for cellular growth and proliferation.""]",0
"[""Therefore, 'mTOR signaling' might be involved in compensatory growth processes at adult stage in LP offspring.""]",0
"Together with the observation that the offspring of both groups did not differ in body weight but in body composition and fat content, the data indicate that the activity of various genes led to diverse partitioning of nutrients among peripheral and visceral organs and tissues.",0
"Therefore, the observed mRNA expression patterns might contribute to an impaired developmental growth in LP offspring.",0
"[""Regarding the LP model used in rodents, it has been suggested that the maternal LP diet had an impact on 'insulin signaling' as well as on 'IGF1 signaling' and its binding proteins [30,39-43].""]",0
"[""However, in this study no regulation of both 'insulin signaling' and 'IGF1 signaling' was observed in liver tissue of LP porcine offspring, possibly due to maturation-, species-, tissue-, sex- and time-dependent regulations.""]",0
"[""Transcriptional excursions regarding lipid-, energy- and N-metabolism\nDuring postnatal development a remarkable number of diet- and stage-dependent transcriptionally regulated pathways were related to lipid metabolism, including 'fatty acid metabolism', 'fatty acid elongation in mitochondria', 'synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies', 'bile acid synthesis' and 'biosynthesis of steroids'.""]",0
These findings suggest that pathways associated to lipid metabolism are part of postnatal adaptive responses to the prenatal nutritional environment in LP offspring.,0
"[""Adverse environmental conditions during fetal development provoke an intrauterine adaptive response termed 'fetal programming', which may lead to both persistently biased responsiveness to extrinsic factors and permanent consequences for the organismal phenotype [1-6].""]",0
"Consistent with these observations, genes associated with lipid metabolism were found to be altered at pre- and postnatal stages in rodents, where the LP model was studied intensively [44-49].",0
"[""Furthermore, the transcriptional adaptations may have consequences for the offspring's phenotype, including alterations of plasma parameters [44-46,50], hepatic histology [46] and body composition [47].""]",0
"On the one hand, this matter may be related to mitochondrial impairments which may happen due to the LP diet, as has been suggested previously [57,58].",0
"On the other hand, it might be associated to the transcriptional excursions within the lipid metabolism in LP offspring.",0
"Moreover, the expression of the catalytic subunits of AMPK, PRKAA1 and PRKAA2 was found to be decreased in LP offspring compared to AP offspring at stage 188 dpn, which may contribute to an imbalanced cellular metabolism.",0
"Taken together, the observed regulations were seen as a clue for impairments in energy metabolism in LP offspring during ontogenesis.",0
"Furthermore, the diet-dependent transcriptional excursions revealed an impact on N-metabolism.",0
"[""In particular, the degradation of essential, branch-chained amino acids like valine, leucine and isoleucine was found to be regulated, which may illustrate the LP offspring's efforts to mimic prenatal experiences in terms of dietary supply during postnatal development in the face of richer conditions.""]",0
"In various human and animal studies a gestational low protein intake during pregnancy was accompanied by low birth weight offspring, which was subsequently predisposed for metabolic disorders and alterations in body composition [6,8-10].",0
"In rodents, many studies reported an impact of maternal low protein diets on expression and affinity of the glucocorticoid receptor and its signaling molecules [8,48,59-61].",0
"[""Consistently, in porcine offspring a diet-dependent regulation of 'glucocorticoid receptor signaling' was also found.""]",0
"Therefore, expression profiles at weaning and adult stages point to an alarm alert (activated defence) in LP offspring.",0
"Obviously, at least a part of the innate immune system is impaired when LP offspring is faced with a pre-biotical stress like weaning.",0
"Consistent with this finding, expression of genes associated with an impaired immunity were found to be altered in offspring of protein malnourished dams [62,63].",0
"Conclusions\nIn conclusion, the longitudinal survey of the hepatic transcriptomic response in offspring of dams fed either a gestational low protein diet (LP, 6% CP) or an adequate protein diet (AP, 12% CP) at prenatal (94 dpc), perinatal (1 dpn), juvenile(28 dpn), and adult (188 dpn) ontogenetic stages revealed acute short-term and delayed long-term modulations.",0
"Interestingly, epidemiological studies in women showed that maternal malnutrition during pregnancy can result in fetal growth retardation [11,12].",0
This stage appeared as a phase of recovery of the activity of genes.,0
"Differential expression of genes related to lipid, ketone body, and amino acid metabolism indicate that the offspring of both groups uses different metabolic directions in response to identical nutritional condition during postnatal life.",0
"Probe-sets with a low standard deviation ( s â‰¤ 0.25) were discarded, because such transcripts are not likely to be regulated.",0
"It should be noted here that the interactions presented in the networks are not specific for porcine liver tissue, as the database contains literature from many different research areas.",0
"In order to contribute to a comprehensive inventory of genes and functional networks that are targets of nutritional programming initiated during fetal life, we applied whole-genome microarrays for expression profiling in a longitudinal experimental design covering prenatal, perinatal, juvenile and adult ontogenetic stages in a porcine model.",0
"On an isoenergetic basis, pregnant sows were fed either a gestational low protein diet (LP, 6% CP) or an adequate protein diet (AP, 12% CP) to investigate the effects on hepatic gene expression in their fetuses and offspring.",0
"[""The experiment comprises a valuable model especially for 'fetal' programming, because cross-fostering enabled assessment of solely the nutritional effects during gestation.""]",0
"Moreover, due to the similarity in metabolism, physiology, anatomy and genome the study is also a beneficial model for nutritional programming in humans [13,14].",0
Thus the experimental data will complement previous findings from rodent models and epidemiological human data.,0
"In particular, the low protein diet provides a model for prenatal dietary undersupply and exposure to famine that regrettably still burdens a considerable proportion of the human population.",0
"At weaning (28 dpn) offspring of the LP group showed slight but significant higher fat content and adipocyte size, and still lower muscle fibre numbers.",0
Here the focus is on the hepatic transcriptomic response.,0
"We present that the hepatic expression profiles showed considerable modulation during prenatal and postnatal stages, i.e.",0
"Results\nWe performed a longitudinal holistic study of the hepatic transcriptome of offspring of dams fed either an experimental low protein diet (LP) or an adequate protein diet (AP) throughout gestation, in order to obtain a comprehensive picture of genes and functional networks that are sensitive to fetal nutritional programming using a porcine model.",0
In order to identify molecular pathways affected by the gestational diets we first analysed differential expression between the dietary groups within each stage separately.,0
"Nutritional fetal programming becomes apparent as an altered hepatic expression of genes related to cell cycle and cell maintenance, and lipid, ketone body, and amino acid metabolism, indicating different functional demands and replies of the liver in both experimental groups under identical nutritional conditions post natum .",0
"[""Adverse environmental conditions during fetal development provoke an intrauterine adaptive response termed 'fetal programming', which may lead to both persistently biased responsiveness to extrinsic factors and permanent consequences for the organismal phenotype.""]",0
The different dietary exposure of the offspring during prenatal development can be expected to cause slight shifts of the developmental age of the offspring that may be reflected by subtle changes of the transcriptome and could hamper the identification of direct effects of the gestational diets on the hepatic expression.,0
"Notably, q-values between ontogenetic stages within diet were remarkable lower ( q â‰¤ 0.05) than between diets within stage ( q â‰¤ 0.25).",0
"[""Ingenuity Pathway Analysis indicates enrichment of molecular routes related to genetic information and nucleic acid processing and cell cycle that were found to be diminished, whereas the 'Wnt signaling' was found to be increased in LP offspring (Table2).""]",0
"[""Genes associated with the 'complement system' showed increased mRNA expression levels, whereas the canonical pathway 'G1/S checkpoint regulation' was found to be decreased in LP offspring.""]",0
"[""The mRNA expression levels of genes associated with metabolic processing of ketones, fatty acids, bile acids, and hydrophobic amino acids (Val, Ile, Leu) as well as 'mTOR signaling', 'VEGF signaling', and 'glucocorticoid receptor signaling', were increased in LP offspring at stage 188 dpn, whereas 'biosynthesis of steroids' was found to be diminished.""]",0
The intersection of commonly regulated genes between those comparisons was discarded because regulation of these genes was likely due to physiologically developmental processes.,0
"Effect on the incidence of pneumonia of vitamin D supplementation by quarterly bolus dose to infants in Kabul: a randomised controlled superiority trial\n\nAbstractSummary\n\nBackground\nVitamin D has a role in regulating immune function, and its deficiency is a suggested risk factor for childhood pneumonia.",0
Our aim was to assess whether oral supplementation of vitamin D3(cholecalciferol) will reduce the incidence and severity of pneumonia in a high-risk infant population.,0
"The ascertainment of study outcomes was robust, and done clinically through masked experienced and retrained paediatricians with Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses clinical definitions of pneumonia applied in other trials18and radiologically through the interpretation of chest radiographs by masked, experienced, and external readers by use of WHO standards.",0
Thus the lack of a protective effect of vitamin D against pneumonia is probably not due to misclassification of outcomes or inadequate supplementation.,0
"Any misclassification of other causes of raised respiratory rate as pneumonia, under-reporting, or over-reporting would be distributed equally between the two groups since the families, doctors, radiographers, radiologists, and data entry staff were masked to the randomisation groupings and the randomisation was successful since the characteristics were balanced between the two groups.",0
"However, a limitation due to the high-risk nature of our population is that the generalisability of our findings to populations with low-to-moderate risk of vitamin deficiency is unknown.",0
"There were fewer deaths than we predicted in both groups, possibly due to the intense health surveillance possible during our study.",0
"Genotyping, which was not practical in our study setting, might have aided the interpretation of our findings, as shown in a vitamin D supplementation trial for tuberculosis.20\nWe accounted for nutritional factors through a diet questionnaire, weight at recruitment, and growth comparison at the end of our studyâ€”any nutritional deficiencies would have been equally balanced between the two groups.",0
"As with other studies, dietary calcium deficiency might have led to so-called wastage of body stores of vitamin D in both groups, affecting the maintenance of even higher vitamin D levels in the intervention group.",0
"Nevertheless, there was a higher (adequate level) mean serum concentration of calcifediol at the end of first supplementation period in the intervention group compared with the lower (not adequate) mean concentrations in the placebo group (data not shown).",0
"From 652 children during five separate periods of testing serum calcifediol, only one child in each of two testing periods had results greater than 375 nmol/L in the intervention groupâ€”a toxic level.",0
"Furthermore, adult fracture-outcome supplementation studies21show no benefit from adding calcium.",0
A further limitation of our study is that it was not feasible to undertake biochemical assessment of the supplements or assess serum concentrations in all participants after each and between supplementation.,0
"A cross-sectional survey during the high-risk winter months in 2005 showed that greater than 95% of children younger than 5 years in a socioeconomically deprived part of Kabul had serum calcifediol levels of less than 37Â·5 nmol/L.12\nOn the basis of findings that vitamin D is an immunomodulator, that deficiency is a risk factor for pneumonia, and that quarterly supplementation had better compliance than daily or weekly supplementation,13,14we aimed to test the hypothesis that quarterly 100\u2008000 IU vitamin D supplementation would reduce the incidence of radiologically confirmed pneumonia by 35% in our study population.",0
We assessed violation of the proportionality assumption with Schoenfeld residuals.,0
"One paediatric trial showed 16% higher rates of tuberculosis symptom resolution,29an adult trial showed 23% greater sputum conversion rate at 6 months,30another trial showed 20% greater restriction of BCG-lux growth in blood,31another trial found accelerated sputum conversion only in a certain genotype of the sample,20whereas yet another found no significant difference in sputum conversion32in the intervention compared with the placebo group.",0
"If so, then in terms of policy and guidelines, it is hard to know what regimen to recommend for future trials, given that clinical practice and evidence suggests that daily or weekly supplementations though ideal are not complied with13,14and are impractical for families, especially in developing countries, and food fortification at the population level will not be an option during exclusive breastfeeding periods (aged <6 months), nor is it likely to be adequate in highly deficient populations.",0
"In populations with similar characteristics, quarterly population level supplementation of vitamin D to infants and young children is not a policy option for reducing the burden of pneumonia in children.",0
Our sample testing suggest that the vitamin D group maintained above mean adequate vitamin D concetrations verses consistently low concentrations in the placebo group.,0
It can be argued that a steady-state adequate vitamin D concentration was not reached in some children because of fluctuations in serum concentrations due to our study regimen.,0
"Although this is probably true, a sufficient serum concentrations for the immunological effects of vitamin D is unknown and could be higher or lower than that of the skeletal system accepted concentrations.6The need for a steady state is currently highly speculative and relates to vitamin D2supplementation for negative cancer22and bone outcomes.23\nOur findings are at odds with smaller case-control hospital studies that show an enhanced rate of vitamin D deficiency or rickets in children with pneumonia and the increasing evidence suggesting that calcitriol, the biologically active metabolite of vitamin D, has an important role in the human immune system.4A systematic review of the role of vitamin D supplementation in infectious diseases had mixed findings, concluding that more rigorously designed clinical trials are needed (panel).25No studies report the effect of vitamin D on radiologically confirmed pneumonias.",0
Introduction\nAfghanistan has the third highest mortality of children younger than 5 years in the world (257 per 1000 livebirths); a leading cause of this is pneumonia.,0
Two hospital-based case-control studies in Ethiopia1and India2suggest that vitamin D deficiency might substantially increase the risk of severe pneumonia in children.,0
"Other trials assessing infections of the upper respiratory tract also had mixed findings: one trial in post-menopausal women26identified reduced self-reported episodes of infection of the upper respiratory tract, specifically in winter, whereas two others in elderly24and general adults27did not identify a difference between the groups with regards to self-reported episodes.",0
"One trial in schoolchildren28(measuring influenza A antigen from swabs) found a statistically significant reduced incidence in the intervention group (RR 0Â·58, 95% CI 0Â·34â€“0Â·99).",0
The benefits of supplementation for tuberculosis are similarly unclear.,0
"Vitamin D is linked with other non-bone health outcomes, but the few completed and adequately powered trials assessing the effect of supplementation have mixed findings in improving outcomesâ€”ie, cancers, vascular disease, and diabetes.",0
"As in our studies, these inconsistent findings point to the existence of complicated pathways for the function of vitamin D in disease processes, or simply that the correct effective dose of vitamin D supplementation needs to be better defined.",0
"The optimum concentrations of vitamin D for adults and children6are based on non-immunological and, mostly, bone outcomes.",0
"An associated issue is that, after the start of our trial, speculations arose that high fluctuations of natural or supplemented vitamin D intake might be linked to negative outcomes.",0
Our systematic review identified one randomised placebo controlled trial3relating pneumonia or lower respiratory infections to vitamin D deficiency supplementation in young children.,0
"These speculations relate two studies in which supplementation of a single large dose (300\u200800033or 500\u200800023IU) of vitamin D for reducing fractures in elderly women led to an increase in fractures, plus similar discrepancies in prostate cancer research with vitamin D.22Our findings and particularly the slightly higher repeat episodes of pneumonia in the vitamin D group could be due to such fluctuations if the hypothesis is true.",0
"However, the risk of repeated pneumonia in the subsequent 3 months was 13% (relative risk [RR] 0Â·78, 95% CI 0Â·64â€“0Â·94; p=0Â·01) lower in the vitamin D3compared with the placebo group.3Other more recent studies assessing different outcomes in children or adults have conflicting findings on the effectiveness of vitamin D.\nThere is growing evidence of the vitamin D parancrine system enhancing innate immunity:4the activation of Toll-like receptors on monocytes and macrophages by microbial pathogens results in increased expression of CYP27B1 and vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) genes within these cells.",0
"Alternately, it might be that immunological effectiveness of supplementation is highly dependent upon other factors as yet unidentified, or other prevalent factors in this high-risk population (for example, other malnutrition factors and that 5Â·5% of the children in our study had a Z score of weight for age below âˆ’3).",0
"Further questions arise with respect to the previous treatment trial in the same region of Kabul, which showed that a single high-dose supplementation with 100\u2008000 IU vitamin D3given orally to young children, along with antibiotic treatment at the time of diagnosis, reduced repeat episodes of pneumonia in the subsequent 3 months.3The inconsistent results could be related to the evidence that stimulation of Toll-like receptors on macrophages and monocytes by bacterial antigens is important in up-regulation of CYP27B1 and the vitamin D receptor,5which are crucial in production of cathelicidins in vitamin-D-depleted individuals.",0
"In other words, this system might not be effective unless there is existing infection with pathogens when vitamin D supplementation is given.",0
"Finally, any possible reduction in the incidence of pneumonia in our trial might be restricted to only certain genotypes as recorded in a single tt genotype after the start of our trial in a study of tuberculosis.20Both the pneumonia treatment and the population supplementation trials need to be repeated in other settings for confirmation, and frequent determination of serum calcifediol concentrations might guide the interpretation of the findings.",0
"As with the trials in the older children, giving higher doses of vitamin D,25,34we too did not record any adverse effects associated with vitamin D supplementation.",0
"However, the number of children and the length of follow-up involved in these studies could only detect common and early adverse effects.",0
"Although vitamin D overload is a theoretical possibility, 100\u2008000 IU of vitamin D3has been shown to provide the best protection against vitamin D deficiency without overload or side-effects in high-risk infants aged 0â€“9 months with normal baseline ranges of vitamin D.16Furthermore, single intramuscular injection of three times this dose (300\u2008000 IU) was safe in treating nutritional rickets in 6â€“30-month-old children residing in lower socioeconomic regions of sunny Istanbul.35Higher than recommended doses of daily supplementation of vitamin D (500â€“1000 IU per day, adding up to 120\u2008000 IU over 3 months) plus additional milk fortified with vitamin D, has been shown not to induce an overload,13including in infants starting with normal ranges of vitamin D, even when supplementation continued during the summer (in France) and when mothers had antenatal vitamin D supplementation.36It is important to note that in our study, where community supplementation was in a population with known high rates of vitamin D deficiency, 1% of children tested had a calcifediol concentration greater than 375 nmol/Lâ€”thought undesirably high.6Although these did not produce any clinical signs and symptoms, these measurements raise a need for caution with doses for population supplementation.",0
The speculative negative role of fluctuations is vitamin D needs to be considered with caution until further evidence is available.,0
We have shown that a quarterly 100\u2008000 IU supplementation of vitamin D3did not reduce the incidence of pneumonias in children living in regions with high vitamin D deficiency.,0
It has been suggested that vitamin D might be used in the treatment of opportunistic and antibiotic-resistant infections.,0
There is debate between investigators regarding concentrations that relate to optimum stores of vitamin D in the body.,0
"In children, serum calcifediol concentrations should be maintained at 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) or greater for skeletal benefits.6Vitamin D deficiency rickets in children younger than 5 years is an endemic problem in developing countries, ranging from 5â€“45%, even where sunlight is abundant,1,2,7,8and has also re-emerged in some developed countries.7,9\nIn people, the main source of vitamin D is through the action of ultraviolet B radiation on 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin, with small amounts derived from dietary sources.",0
"Therefore, breastmilk, a normally poor source of vitamin D,11becomes even more deficient.",0
"Furthermore, the common practice of swaddling infants might reduce exposure to sunlight.2Thus young children are at a high risk of vitamin D deficiency.",0
"Our secondary hypotheses were that supplementation would reduce all pneumonias (radiologically confirmed or clinically defined), repeat episodes of pneumonia, hospital admissions, and all cause mortality.",0
"Procedures\nWe chose a quarterly supplementation regimen because in routine programme conditions a quarterly regimen is likely to have better adherence than a daily regimen,13,14and has been shown to be effective at maintaining the serum vitamin D concentration within normal ranges for 2â€“3 months in a French high-risk infant population.16The syringes containing vitamin D or placebo were stored in conditions recommended by the manufacturerâ€”a dry cool environmentâ€”between 2 and 24 weeks before administration.",0
"Statistical analysis\nWe assumed that the incidence of the first or the only episode of pneumonia (first episode) in our placebo group would be 0Â·0585 per child per year based on the report that the incidence of acute lower respiratory infections in developing countries was greater than 0Â·65 per child per year,18that 12% of these episodes were pneumonia, and 75% were first episodes.",0
"Given that 73% of children had vitamin D deficiency in the study region in 2005,12and that the incidence of pneumonia was ten-times higher in vitamin D deficient children than in children without a deficiency in case-control studies1,2we postulated that there would be at least a 35% reduction in pneumonia incidence in the vitamin D compared with the placebo group.",0
To assess the potential problem of multicollinearity we used Pearsons correlation coefficient or Cramers V (for paired categorical variables).,0
"The difference was not statistically significant, although our study was not powered to detect differences in death rate.",0
"On intention-to-treat analysis, the incidence of the first episode of pneumonia was greater in the vitamin D rather than the placebo group, although this difference was not statistically significant (table 2).",0
"[""The mean serum calcifediol concentration was consistently and significantly higher in the vitamin D group than in the placebo group at 1 week, 4 weeks, and 3 months after administration of the first dose of vitamin D during the winter and at 2 weeks' post administration of dose 3 (spring;figure 3).""]",0
Herb use among low income women at an urban tertiary care center and their communications with prenatal care providers\n\nPurpose\nLittle is known about the use of herbs in low income underserved mothers and patterns of communication about herb use to prenatal providers.,0
"We asked women if they discussed the use of herbs with their prenatal care provider, and how satisfied they were with these discussions; we asked the same questions about prenatal vitamin use for comparison.",0
We did not find any medical record documentation of a discussion about herb use.,0
"Conclusion\nIn this study 39% of women reported using herbs during pregnancy, a higher frequency than reported in other studies.",0
"It is important that providers be given the tools to empower them to discuss herbal medicine use with patients, and are encouraged to do so.",0
"We sought to examine these issues among women delivering at Boston Medical Center (BMC), an urban medical center serving many of the low income and underserved populations of Boston, Massachusetts.",0
"Methods\nWe interviewed women from the inpatient post-natal unit at BMC about what herbs they used during pregnancy, socioeconomic factors, changes to diet, and use of prenatal vitamins.",0
Preventive Treatments of Iron Deficiency Anaemia in Pregnancy: A Review of Their Effectiveness and Implications for Health System Strengthening\n\nAbstract\nObjectives .,0
Evidence abounds on their effectiveness in reducing the prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy.,0
"Therefore, an average daily dose of 4â€“6\u2009mg of iron is required in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy [14].",0
"Overall, a woman requires about 2â€“2.8\u2009mg of iron per day during pregnancy [17].",0
"But she will need to consume much more to obtain this daily requirement (i.e., between 20 and 48\u2009mg of dietary iron) [18].",0
"However, literature has presented different views on iron requirements during pregnancy ranging from 450 to 1,150\u2009mg with a median of 790\u2009mg [14,19â€“21].",0
"Since these requirements are difficult to meet through an ordinary diet, especially in developing countries where most diets do not contain adequate bioavailable iron, routine iron supplementation in pregnancy has been found to be of immense benefit [14,19â€“21].",0
"However, there is a limitation to the use of some of these biochemical indicators of iron status in certain settings and conditions; thus, necessitating caution in their interpretations.",0
"However, these prospects are threatened by side effects of iron supplements, low utilization of maternal health service in developing countries, partial implementation of preventive treatments, and weak infrastructure and political commitment to implement mass fortification of local staple foods by national governments.",0
"For example, serum ferritin level, being an acute-phase protein, is raised in associated underlying infections and long-term diseases; it can therefore give a false normal or high level in a state of iron deficiency.",0
"Whereas in pregnancy, serum ferritin levels decline even in women ingesting daily supplements of iron [22â€“24].",0
There are different forms of preventive treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy.,0
"The first choice in the prophylaxis of iron deficiency anaemia for almost all women is oral iron replacement because of its effectiveness, safety, and low cost [25].",0
"Oral iron, either as iron sulphate or fumarate, is the most commonly used preventive treatment for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy.",0
Direct iron supplementation has been extensively used in most developing countries as an intervention to prevent iron deficiency and consequently anaemia during pregnancy [7].,0
"Thus, preventive treatment with iron supplements has always been given in combination with folic acid and this has been included as part of routine antenatal care provided to pregnant women at every visit in developing countries [26].",0
The rationale for this combination is to meet increased folic acid requirements in pregnancy brought about by the rapidly dividing cells in the fetus and elevated urinary losses [7].,0
"The International Nutritional Anaemia Consultative Group had recommended a daily dose of 60\u2009mg of iron for pregnant nonanaemic women, if supplementation for more than six months is possible before delivery [27].",0
An increased daily dose of 120\u2009mg of iron is further suggested if the duration of supplementation in pregnant nonanaemic women is shorter or where the prevalence of iron deficiency in women is high or in settings where pregnant women are generally anaemic [27].,0
"This supplement should include 400\u2009 Î¼ g of folic acid or lower doses, if this amount is not available [7].",0
Sustainability of effectiveness of preventive treatments of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy could be achieved if the identified threats are adequately addressed.,0
Food fortification with iron has thus become a promising approach for preventing iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy in developing countries.,0
Iron fortification of foods might be particularly useful and cost effective in settings where the logistics of oral iron supplementation among pregnant women are highly challenging.,0
"In addition, it is found very useful in developing countries where the rate of compliance with preventive treatment of iron is poor [4].",0
"To this end, a variety of food items such as cereal flour (maize or wheat), salt, beverage, milk, sugar, noodles, rice, and fish sauce had been fortified with iron and used successfully as dietary supplements to boost iron stores, and hence improve haemoglobin levels in the population [28â€“31].",0
Prophylaxis Iron Supplements\nThe overall impact of interventions on iron supplementation under field conditions has been limited and its effectiveness questioned [33].,0
"These concerns had been attributed to inadequate infrastructure and poor compliance with preventive treatment, among others [34].",0
"Furthermore, the effectiveness of this intervention has been evaluated mostly in terms of improvement in haemoglobin concentration, rather than maternal or infant health [35].",0
"For example, a randomized controlled trial among pregnant women in Switzerland showed that the parenteral route of iron prophylaxis of anaemia has no clinically significant benefit over oral route as there was no significant difference in maternal outcomes and serious adverse events between the two groups [25].",0
A Cochrane review of a randomized control trial conducted in Pakistan reported that daily iron treatment is better than intermittent iron supplementation in increasing haemoglobin level at delivery among pregnant women in developing countries [2].,0
"Findings from other studies on routine daily or weekly antenatal iron or iron plus folic acid supplementation showed that it may be of benefit, especially where pregestational iron deficiency and anaemia are prevalent [7].",0
"A recently published randomized study found no difference in most pregnancy outcomes between daily and twice weekly iron supplementation regimens, though the daily regimen was found to be more effective than twice weekly regimen in preventing Hb decrement at near term [8].",0
"The timing and dosage of oral iron are also controversial as most studies have focused on preventive treatment from midpregnancy, at or before 20 weeks gestation [4].",0
"Some researchers, on the other hand, believe that both daily and weekly iron supplementation are relatively unsuccessful in the reduction of prevalence of anemia in pregnancy.",0
"They opined that sufficient attention should be paid to adolescent girls and women of reproductive age long before pregnancy and suggested intermittent low-dose iron supplements and in some cases, combined with necessary micronutrients [36,37].",0
"Apart from its effectiveness, it was argued that intermittent supplementation is more physiological by avoiding mucosal absorption block and excessive pooling of intestinal iron with associated oxidative stress; furthermore, it has logistic advantages of distribution particularly in areas of limited supply and many of the gastrointestinal side effects of daily iron are avoided [4].",0
"Experiences on parenteral iron use are predominantly, but not exclusively, from the developed world as reports of its prophylactic use in pregnancy are scant; this may be related to concerns about adverse reactions associated with its use in parenteral form.",0
"However, intravenous iron sucrose in particular has been used in several recent studies and might be highly beneficial in refractory patients or those intolerant of oral iron formulations [4].",0
"[""The initial reduction has been explained to result from increased red cell mass and demands of the fetus which exceeds iron intake with consequent reduction in iron stores of the woman's body [2].""]",0
"Though, because of its immediate bioavailability, it may result in a more rapid rise in haemoglobin level in anaemic patients compared with oral iron; but it probably does not confer an advantage in preventing anaemia in pregnancy [25,38].",0
"The WHO technical working group on the prevention and the treatment of severe anaemia has documented that parenteral iron therapy produces a rapid and complete correction of iron deficiency, including replacement of iron stores; thereby producing a more rapid erythropoietic response than oral iron replacement [39].",0
"However, its use should be limited to a selected group of patients who are unable to tolerate oral iron and in whom oral iron therapy fails due to noncompliance.",0
It is also indicated in pregnant women whose hemoglobin level is required to be restored rapidly such as those who present too close to term and those who have severe anemia [40].,0
"Food Fortification with Iron\nFood fortification with iron has also been shown to be an equally effective strategy of boosting haemoglobin level in the population, including pregnant women.",0
Asibey-Berko et al.,0
"in 2007 recorded 19.5% significant increase in the prevalence of anaemia among rural Ghanaian women, who were not exposed to iron-fortified salt [29].",0
"It was also shown that iron fortification of sugar (with mean intake of 4\u2009mg/day) in nonpregnant Guatemalan women over three years resulted in a substantial increase in iron stores, with reserves still increasing by about 40\u2009mg/year after the third year [41].",0
"Thus, the World Health Organization has defined anaemia in pregnancy as a haemoglobin value below 11\u2009g/dL [1,3].",0
"Furthermore, two Vietnamese studies showed similar improvements in iron stores following ingestion of ironfortified fish sauce for six to 12 months [42,43].",0
"Comparable results were documented with dietary supplements containing iron and ironfortified milk [30,31].",0
"Partial Implementation of Preventive Treatments\nThe success of routine iron and folate supplementation, especially in areas with a high prevalence of anemia, recommended as a component of antenatal care package for all pregnant women by the World Health Organization is threatened by the practice of partial implementation of preventive treatments of health workers.",0
"Alternatively, an equally effective, safe, and affordable iron compound with little or no side effect can be developed for use especially in public health antenatal supplementation programmes.",0
Side Effects of Iron Supplements\nGastrointestinal distress is commonly observed in women consuming high levels of supplemental iron on an empty stomach [7].,0
"Thus, occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms is usually considered as a critical adverse effect on which a tolerable upper intake level for iron is based for an individual.",0
"High dose of oral iron supplements is commonly associated with gastrointestinal effects such as constipation, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; the frequency and severity of which vary according to the amount of elemental iron released into the stomach.",0
We conducted a review of effectiveness of preventive treatments of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy in developing countries and highlighted their constraints as well as interventions required to strengthen the health services.,0
"In addition, elevation of â€œ free iron â€ in the plasma and hence lipid peroxidation which is indicative of oxidative stress has been reported [44â€“46].",0
"Intramuscular or intravenous iron is thought to be associated with allergic reactions and anaphylactic shock; furthermore, parenteral iron is thought to predispose to venous thrombosis and occasionally cardiac arrest and death [2].",0
"Parenteral iron sucrose complex is known to have several advantages because of its low-allergenic properties and consequently, an extremely low incidence of severe side effects such as anaphylactic reactions [47,48]; however, its use requires caution as it may not be completely devoid of side effect.",0
"[""There are two known factors which contribute to development of iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) in pregnancy; the first is the woman's iron stores at the time of conception and the second is the amount of iron absorbed during gestation.""]",0
Other disadvantages of intravenous iron supplementation include cost and invasiveness of the procedure.,0
"However, it is argued that cost benefit of intravenous iron prophylaxis may be large taking into consideration the opportunity costs of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, blood transfusions, and hospitalization [25].",0
Low Utilization of Maternal Health Service in Developing Countries\nIt is well established that antenatal care provides pregnant women with opportunities to receive cost-effective interventions which are beneficial to mother and child; these interventions include preventive treatments of iron deficiency anemia.,0
"However, the potentials of antenatal service have not been maximally utilized in developing countries.",0
This is because these settings are characterized by poor maternal health service indicators such as nonutilization of service or delayed antenatal visit.,0
"For example, researchers have reported a common occurrence of unbooked pregnancies [49,50] and a wide range (60% to 90%) of antenatal care utilization rates (i.e., antenatal care clinic attendance of at least once during most recent pregnancy) [51â€“53].",0
Researchers have persistently reported noncompliance with this recommendation at a given antenatal visit.,0
Van Eijk et al.,0
"in 2006 reported that 53% and 44% of pregnant women received iron and folate supplementation, respectively, during last pregnancy [54].",0
"Other studies reported 36â€“54% iron supplementation [51,55].",0
The fact that anaemia frequently does occur in pregnancy among women in developing countries is an indication that preexisting iron stores are often inadequate and physiological adaptations to pregnancy are insufficient to meet the increased requirements [4].,0
"Weak Infrastructure and Political Commitment\nThe efforts of World Food Programme (WFP) in overcoming micronutrient deficiencies in nutritionally-vulnerable groups and low-income food-deficit countries continue to be thwarted by challenges such as technical and managerial capacity constraints, the need for systematic compliance with procurement specifications and quality control, clearer policies on micronutrient content labeling, and the need for cash resources to support many aspects associated with local processing and fortification activities [57].",0
Recommendations\nThe World Health Organization has recommended that weekly iron and folic acid supplementation should be considered as a strategy for prevention of iron deficiency in population groups.,0
This is particularly so where the prevalence of anemia is above 20% among women of reproductive age [58].,0
"Since iron tablets induce a high concentration of free radicals in the intestinal milieu, which may damage the intestinal epithelium, the minimal essential iron dose is to be recommended [59].",0
"Therefore, there is a need to establish effective and safe doses of supplemental iron with folic acid either as daily or weekly supplementation; this should take into consideration nutritional and haematological status of women in developing countries.",0
"Though compliance with weekly dosage may be better than daily regimen because of reduced side effects, it is desirable to conduct further field randomized controlled trials in order to establish the efficacy of weekly supplementation compared to daily regimen.",0
"To this end, we recommend a cue to be taken from new approaches to iron fortification technology development whereby iron-mediated undesirable taste and appearance are prevented while its stability and bioavailability are preserved [60].",0
"While this approach is being pursued, we recommend that appropriate measures be taken to strengthen the existing health systems in dealing with gastro-intestinal and life-threatening side effects of iron supplements.",0
"Thus, clinical skills of local health staff could be improved through targeted trainings such as the WHO training on Life Saving Skills [61] for health workers.",0
"Though the training lays emphasis on core midwifery skills, it could be expanded to include cardiopulmonary resuscitation of mothers; furthermore, local health staff should be provided with appropriate state-of-art equipment to work with.",0
"Hence, iron supplementation in pregnancy has become a standard and routine practice as a preventive treatment for iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy in developing countries.",0
"Although, laboratories at the health facilities in developing countries usually lack the capacity to conduct quality blood test, they could be strengthened to provide reliable estimations of red blood cell indices such as haemoglobin, haematocrit, mean cell volume, mean cell haemoglobin, and mean cell haemoglobin concentration.",0
"Where possible, estimation of serum ferritin level is desirable to adjust the dose of iron supplements [62].",0
"With respect to partial implementation of preventive treatment, local health staff should be encouraged on adherence to the guidelines on antenatal care package at any given antenatal visit so that partial implementation of preventive treatments is minimized.",0
"Mass fortification programme of common local staple foods with iron and folic acid is a long-term goal, which national governments in developing countries should consider as a strategy aimed at reducing the prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia in the general population.",0
"Since iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy is determined by preexisting body iron stores, among other factors, we recommend that the mass fortification programme should be located and implemented within the context of reproductive health services.",0
Conclusions\nIron deficiency remains the most important cause of anaemia in pregnancy in developing countries.,0
"Hence, its contribution to increased risks of low birth weight, prematurity, and maternal morbidity cannot be underscored.",0
"Prophylaxis iron supplement and food fortification with iron have the prospects of improving maternal and child health, except for the identified constraints.",0
"In view of the foregoing, a review of effectiveness of preventive treatments of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy was conducted; furthermore, constraints were highlighted and suggestions for improvement were provided.",0
Methods\nWe conducted a review of literature on evidence-based preventive treatments of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy with particular reference to developing countries.,0
"This paper was limited to the six randomised and quasi-randomised trials (listed inTable 1) on preventive treatments of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy, which met at least one of the following inclusion criteria: (i) comparison between daily routine oral supplementation with iron or ironfolic acid and no supplementation/placebo; (ii) comparison between daily routine oral supplementation with iron or ironfolic acid and routine-intermittent (weekly and twice weekly) regimens; (iii) comparison between intermittent oral iron or ironfolic acid supplementation and no supplementation/placebo; (iv) comparison between intravenous route versus oral route of iron supplementation; (v) comparison between food fortification with iron and no fortification/placebo.",0
"Prevalence and Burden of Iron Deficiency Anaemia in Pregnancy in Developing Countries\nWorldwide, anemia affects over two billion people and the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that half of these are due to iron deficiency [5,6].",0
"Iron deficiency is not only the most prevalent but also the most neglected nutrient deficiency in the world, particularly among pregnant women and children in developing countries [7].",0
"Presently, over 40 million pregnant women suffer from iron deficiency (ID) and its consequences in developing countries [8].",0
Iron deficiency anaemia accounts for 75â€“95% of cases of anaemia in pregnancy [9].,0
"Iron-deficiency anaemia, the late manifestation of chronic iron deficiency, is thought to be the most common nutrient deficiency among pregnant women [10].",0
"Studies conducted on pregnant women in Zimbabwe, China, India, and Mexico from 1996 to 2008 indicated that between 43% and 73% of the women were iron deficient (usually diagnosed as a low-ferritin concentration); out of these, 7% to 33% had IDA [4].",0
"Among pregnant women, IDA has been associated with increased risks of low birth weight, prematurity, and maternal morbidity [11].",0
"UNICEF has reported deaths of an estimated 50,000 young women per year globally in pregnancy and childbirth due to severe iron deficiency anemia [12].",0
Evidence-based preventive treatment options for iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy include prophylaxis iron supplements and food fortification with iron.,0
The high frequency of iron deficiency anaemia in the developing countries has substantial health and economic cost implications.,0
An analysis of 10 developing countries reported $0.32 per head or 0.57% of gross domestic product as a median value of physical productivity loss per year resulting from iron deficiency [13].,0
Prophylaxis Iron Supplements\nThe high physiological requirement for iron in pregnancy is difficult to meet with most diets; this is so especially in developing countries where food requirement is a problem.,0
"During pregnancy, iron requirements are not uniform [14].",0
Fetal demands for iron are maximal during the third trimester and these are estimated at about 270\u2009mg in a 3\u2009kg fetus [16].,0
"High Prevalence of Vitamin D Deficiency in Pregnant Women: A National Cross-Sectional Survey\n\nAbstract\nAn increasing number of studies suggest that vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is associated with multiple adverse health outcomes in mothers, neonates and children.",0
The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among Belgian pregnant women and to assess the determinants of vitamin D status in the first and third trimester of pregnancy.,0
"Only 24.2% of all pregnant women started taking multivitamins before pregnancy, while 46.6% of these women started taking multivitamins within the first trimester of pregnancy.",0
"In addition the risk of vitamin D deficiency was significantly lower in summer, spring and autumn compared to winter (Table 4).10.1371/journal.pone.0043868.t004\n\nCaption (TABLE-WRAP): TABLE 4\nRisk of vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy in Belgium (25-(OH)D <20 ng/ml) (n\u200a=\u200a1100), results of multiple logistic regressions.N of subjectsN of deficient casesOR[95% Conf Interval]p Season Winter4702781.000Spring3841270.2340.1650.332<0.001Summer93120.1000.0490.203<0.001Autumn3511660.5500.3910.7750.001BMI*1.0511.0221.080<0.001 Smoking yes2191181.000no10784650.7010.4801.0250.067 Use of multivitamins containing vitamin D no4893171.000yes8092660.2240.1680.300<0.001 Ethnicity Caucasian, white9553691.000Asiatic33192.8231.2356.4540.014African (black)64341.3090.6942.4680.406North African1741306.0483.8139.595<0.001Hispanic1275.3051.54918.1670.008 Education level Secondary education or less7194131.000High school3531080.4880.3490.681<0.001University195520.5090.3310.7830.002 Frequency of fish consumption (non-fatty fish) Never2261171.000Less than once a month225900.5640.3540.8970.0161â€“3 days a month5052160.8390.5641.2480.3861 day per week2701240.7940.5061.2480.3182â€“4 days a week or more frequent69350.5620.2891.0950.090 Sometimes going on holidays to sunny climates Yes8823661.000No4082151.7031.2482.3240.001\nFirst trimester BMI used as a proxy for prepregnancy BMI.",0
On the other hand risk of severe vitamin D deficiency decreased for women who reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy.,0
"As those authors recognize that the evidence to propose such intakes is scarce and as long as the health benefits of having serum 25(OH)D levels higher than 30 ng/ml are not clearly established particularly in pregnant women, the Belgian Superior Health council still recommends a vitamin D supplement of 20 Âµg/day or 800 IU during pregnancy[58].",0
"In the absence of survey data from other European countries, we suspect that the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Belgium likely reflects the situation in other Western European countries.",0
"Interestingly, risk of severe vitamin D deficiency decreased with more frequent use of sunscreen lotion and increased for women who reported preference for shadow (Table 5).",0
"Discussion\nDespite the fact that more than 60% of the pregnant women reported taking multivitamins containing vitamin D during pregnancy, nearly 45% of the women were vitamin D deficient (25-(OH)D <20 ng/ml).",0
A previous small study in Brussels suggested that the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was high among the adult population and that immigrants were at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency[32].,0
Other small-scale studies in Belgium showed a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among Belgian postmenopausal osteoporotic women[33]and elderly[34].,0
"However, the present study is the first national survey on vitamin D status among pregnant women in Belgium.",0
"Of all women, 74.1% (95%CI\u200a=\u200a71.8â€“76.5%) were vitamin D insufficient (25-(OH)D <30 ng/ml), 44.6% (95%CI\u200a=\u200a41.9â€“47.3%) were vitamin D deficient (25-(OH)D <20 ng/ml), while 12.1% (95%CI\u200a=\u200a10.3â€“13.8%) were severely vitamin D deficient (25-(OH)D <10 ng/ml).",0
The high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Belgium stems from the fact that the contribution of dietary sources to the vitamin D status is negligible as was shown by the Flemish food consumption survey among preschoolers which estimated the mean vitamin D intake at only 2 Âµg/day[35].,0
"The prevalence of vitamin deficiency (25-(OH)D <20 ng/ml) is high in many European countries[36]â€“[43]and some studies suggest that pregnant women in Europe are also at high risk of vitamin D deficiency[29],[30].",0
"The variations of 25-(OH)D concentration with seasons reflect the changes in UVB exposure, one of the main determinants of vitamin D status in many European countries.",0
The association of vitamin D status with BMI has been attributed to an excessive storage of vitamin D in fat tissue decreasing thereby serum concentrations[47].,0
"Ethnicity was also a major determinant of vitamin D status in the present study, as previously reported in the adult population[32]and in pregnant women[29],[48],[49].",0
"Of all women included, 62.0% reported taking vitamin D-containing multivitamins, of which only 24.2% started taking those before pregnancy.",0
In addition education level was associated with vitamin D status in our pregnant women population.,0
Smoking increased the risk of both vitamin D deficiency and severe vitamin D deficiency; the mechanism for this appears to be unclear[50].,0
Interestingly the risk for severe vitamin D deficiency was lower among women who reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy.,0
The latter has been found also among Korean men[51].,0
Variables influencing the formation of previtamin D3 in the skin include skin pigmentation and intensity of the solar UV light[52]â€“[55].,0
"In summer, light-skinned people who spend at least 15 minutes outside during the day with their hands and face exposed will have adequate vitamin D levels.",0
Sunscreen lotions prevent UV radiation from reaching the skin and might therefore reduce the skinâ€™s vitamin D production[56].,0
"However, another study found this effect to be only minor[57].",0
"In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among pregnant women in Belgium and this raises concerns about the health consequences for the mother and the offspring.",0
The latter is possibly due to the fact that women using sunscreen lotion are more often exposed to the sun.,0
"The adequate intake of vitamin D during pregnancy and lactation is unknown, although it appears to be greater than the current dietary recommendations of 400 IU/d or 10 Âµg/d[58].",0
Some studies suggest that the dietary requirement during pregnancy and lactation may be as high as 6000 IU/d[59]and recognize that at least 1500â€“2000 IU/d of vitamin D may be needed in order to maintain a blood level of 25(OH)D above 30 ng/ml[24].,0
A targeted screening strategy to detect and treat women at high risk of severe vitamin D deficiency is needed in Belgium and in Europe.,0
"However, the vitamin D content of multivitamins for pregnant women in Belgium is only 400 IU indicating even this recommendation is not followed as pregnant women only take one multivitamin pill a day.",0
This assumption is based on the fact that the main risk factors associated with vitamin D deficiency (sun exposure and/or ethnicity) are common to many European countries.,0
"In addition to the uncertainty concerning the optimal vitamin D intakes preventing vitamin D deficiency, there exists also a lack of recommendations to treat vitamin D deficient pregnant women.",0
Even in the last published guidelines the treatment of vitamin D deficient women is not specifically discussed[24].,0
The uncovering of the magnitude of vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women in Belgium (and Western Europe) should be translated into new research in order to fill the huge knowledge gap concerning the adequate amount of vitamin D to prevent and treat vitamin D deficient pregnant women.,0
"In addition, an increasing number of studies suggest that gestational vitamin D deficiency is associated with multiple adverse health outcomes in mothers and children[16]â€“[22].",0
"Therefore, there is an urgent need of randomised controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation to investigate the maternal and neonatal health benefits of correcting vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy[24].",0
"Introduction\nVitamin D status is a well-known determinant of bone health[1],[2].",0
"Given the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women in Belgium and probably in many European countries, a vitamin D nutrition policy is needed at the country and European level.",0
The current vitamin D recommendations for pregnant women are clearly insufficient to prevent and even more to treat vitamin D deficient pregnant women.,0
"Until the adequate treatment of vitamin D deficient pregnant women is established, a safe approach may be to correct vitamin D deficiency by targeting pregnant women at high risk of severe vitamin D deficiency.",0
"In addition the current vitamin D content of multivitamins for pregnancy, 400 IU, do not even comply with the current Belgian recommendations of 800 IU per day, therefore a prudent step should at least be to increase the vitamin D content in multivitamins for pregnant women to 800 IU.",0
"The ubiquitous presence of vitamin D receptors in most tissues, including the placenta, suggests that vitamin D may have other roles as well.",0
"In conclusion, despite that more than 60% of the pregnant women reported taking multivitamins containing vitamin D, vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among pregnant women in Belgium and up to 12% of pregnant women are severely vitamin D deficient.",0
A targeted screening strategy to detect and treat women at high risk of severe vitamin D deficiency is clearly needed in Belgium and in other European countries.,0
"While several observational studies point to correlations between vitamin D insufficiency and maternal and neonatal ill health, experimental evidence from supplementation clinical trials is needed to inform health policy.",0
"Adequate vitamin D intake is associated with a lower risk of cancer[7],[8],[9],[10],[11], cardiovascular diseases[12], autoimmune diseases[13], neurological disorders[14]and diabetes[15].",0
"In addition, an increasing number of studies suggest that vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is associated with multiple adverse health outcomes in mothers (gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia), in neonates (wheezing) and children (low bone mineral density, type-1 diabetes, eczema)[16]â€“[22].",0
"However there is so far no conclusive evidence about the causality of these relationships, as no randomised controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation with an appropriate assessment of a variety of health outcomes have been carried out to date[21].",0
"Due to its longer half-life, 25-(OH)D is considered the best bio-marker of vitamin D status.",0
"The role of 1,25-(OH)2D during pregnancy to increase intestinal calcium absorption is since long acknowledged[24].",0
The cut-off points used to define vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency are not well established and remain controversial.,0
There are no representative country data available on vitamin D status of pregnant women in Europe.,0
"Nevertheless there is a consensus to consider serum 25-(OH)D below 20 ng/ml as inadequately low[25], and some evidence suggests that values higher than 30 ng/ml may be associated with better health outcomes in the adult population.[26],[27].",0
The uncertainty concerning the optimal serum 25-(OH)D concentration in pregnant women is even higher.,0
As long as the proposed values are not validated in clinical trials the controversy will remain[28].,0
"There is a growing concern about the health consequences of the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency worldwide among the general population, including pregnant women.",0
The adequacy of the current vitamin D dietary recommendations to reach an optimal vitamin D status during pregnancy has been questioned[24].,0
"Although previous small surveys suggest that vitamin D deficiency among pregnant women is common in Europe[29],[30], there are no reliable country-wide estimates of vitamin D status of pregnant women in European countries.",0
Therefore the aim of this study was to carry out the first national representative random sample survey on vitamin D status in pregnant women in a European country and to assess the determinants of vitamin D status in the first and third trimester of pregnancy.,0
In each clinic all gynaecologist-obstetricians were invited to participate in order to level out a possible gynaecologist effect.,0
First trimester BMI was used as a proxy for prepregnancy BMI for both first and third trimester pregnant women.,0
"Of all women included, 15% smoked during pregnancy and 12% reported having drunk alcohol during pregnancy (Table 2).10.1371/journal.pone.0043868.t002\n\nCaption (TABLE-WRAP): TABLE 2\nCharacteristics of the pregnant women included in the study (n\u200a=\u200a1311) (Belgian national survey on vitamin D status in pregnant women, 2010â€“2011).CharacteristicNMean age28.5Â±5.11305Mean BMI*(kg/m2)24.4Â±5.11290% Underweight5.6673% Healthy weight59.20763% Overweight22.09285% Obese13.10169 Ethnicity % White/Caucasian73.61965% Asiatic2.5233% African (Black)4.8864% North African13.42176% Hispanic0.9212% Not known4.6561 Education level % Secondary education or lower54.54715% Higher education27.23357% University or higher14.87195% Other education0.233% No diploma0.699% Not known2.4432 Smoking % Yes16.78220% Of which during past 4 wks15.41202% No82.911087% Not known0.314 Drinking alcohol % Yes20.37267% Of which during past 4 wks11.51151% No78.491029% Not known1.1415\nFirst trimester BMI used as a proxy for prepregnancy BMI.",0

110\u2003Is Pet Ownership Associated with Higher Vitamin D?,0
"Abstract\n\nBackground\nPet keeping has been linked with decreased risk of allergic sensitization, which has been associated with the Hygiene Hypothesis; and more recently, by ourselves and others, to particular home microbiome patterns.",0
"Another factor possibly associated with pet ownership is increased Vitamin D among family members as pet keeping may be correlated with lifestyles involving increased outdoor exposure, such as dog walking.",0
Prenatal vitamin D inadequacy has been hypothesized as a risk factor for pediatric atopy and asthma.,0
"Methods\nTo investigate potential relationships between household pet exposure and cord blood vitamin D concentrations, we analyzed information from a large, geographically-based, general risk birth cohort.",0
"Because of notable differences in vitamin D concentrations between African Americans and Whites, analyses were stratified by race.",0
"Conclusions\nIn a large ethnically diverse cohort of newborns, the presence of a pet in the home during the prenatal time period was associated with higher cord blood vitamin D, but only among Whites.",0
"For Whites, but not African Americans, having no pet compared to 1 or >1 pet during pregnancy was associated with lower cord blood vitamin D concentrations (37.7, 45.2, 47.0 nmol/L, respectively, P = 0.001).",0
"Considering type of pet, the relationship for no pet compared to 1 or >1 dog (37.7, 46.1, 49.9 nmol/L, respectively, P = 0.001) was similar to that for no pet versus 1 or >1 cat (37.7, 43.0, 46.5 nmol/L, respectively, P = 0.065).",0
This racial difference may reflect an impact on pet owner behavior resulting in increased outdoor exposure that is limited to lighter skinned individuals.,0
"[""However, as the effect doesn't vary by cats versus dogs, differences by race in factors correlated with pet ownership or variations in pet keeping styles may be more important.""]",0
Vitamin D should be considered in studies of pets and atopic conditions.,0
Acute Type A Aortic Dissection in a 36-Week Pregnant Patient\n\nAbstract\nAortic dissection is a relatively rare yet often fatal condition.,0
"A review of the literature revealed a paucity of published cases describing the successful, emergent repair of acute type A aortic dissections in third- trimester gravid patients.",0
Introduction\nAortic dissection is a rare complication of pregnancy with significant morbidity and mortality for both the mother and infant.,0
"In the general population, aortic dissection has an estimated incidence of 2.9 per 100,000 person years [1].",0
Acute aortic dissection during the third trimester of pregnancy has been attributed to hemodynamic alterations that occur in late pregnancy.,0
"A high index of suspicion by the emergency physician in addition to successful coordination of care between the emergency physician, obstetrician, and cardiothoracic/vascular surgeon is necessary for a successful outcome.",0
We obtained a CT angiography of the chest due to our high index of suspicion for an acute aortic dissection.,0
Discussion\nAortic dissection is a rare complication of pregnancy with significant morbidity and mortality for both the mother and infant.,0
"A recent 2011 population-based study of acute type A aortic dissection in pregnancy revealed an overall incidence of 0.4 cases per 100,000 person-years and a prehospital mortality rate of 53% [2].",0
A longitudinal study over a period of 27 years discovered that aortic dissection was the initial clinical diagnosis in only 15% of patients presenting with an aortic dissection [1].,0
"While there are no firmly established practice guidelines, it has been suggested that before 28 weeks of gestation, aortic repair should proceed without cesarean section and after 32 weeks gestation, emergency cesarean section precede aortic repair [6].",0
"Between 28 and 32 weeks, the risks and benefits of early delivery should be considered.",0
Early recognition and treatment are crucial for survival.,0
"Although relatively rare, clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for aortic dissection in any pregnant female who presents with acute onset chest pain.",0
"Early recognition by the emergency physician in addition to successful coordination of care between the emergency physician, obstetrician, and cardiothoracic/vascular surgeon is necessary for a successful outcome.",0
Also the present diet substances causes complication.,0
Thus Masanumasik patya is the need of the hour.,0
"Conclusion:\nIt is therefore clear that the diet of pregnant woman according to Ayurveda will prevent many complications of pregnancy, which will lead to healthy pregnancy & healthy fetus & finally good outcome.",0
masanumasik patya which will lead to healthly & safe motherhood along with its outcome.,0
"Thus, patya advised is madhura, shita, drava (liquid), which will prevent dehydration & supply required nourishment.",0
"Mild laxatives and basti, which will smoothen genital tract.",0
"Thus, it is very necessary to promote the pregnant women to take proper diet i.e.",0
"Gestational Diabetes Insipidus Associated with HELLP Syndrome: A Case Report\n\nAbstract\nGestational diabetes insipidus is a rare, but well recognized, complication of pregnancy.",0
"A high index of suspicion of gestational diabetes insipidus is required in a correct clinical setting especially in the presence of other risk factors such as preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, and twin pregnancies.",0
The newborn in this case also had hypernatremia thereby raising possibilities of vasopressinase crossing the placenta.,0
"Introduction\nGestational diabetes insipidus is a rare complication of pregnancy, and it is related to excess vasopressinase activity.",0
"Measurement of the vasopressinase serum concentrations is not available commercially, and the diagnosis is usually established based on the clinical presentation and the appropriate laboratory studies.",0
We are describing a unique case of gestational diabetes insipidus in a patient with HELLP syndrome.,0
"Discussion\nGestational diabetes insipidus is a rare complication of pregnancy that occurs in 4 out of 100,000 pregnancies as discussed by Durr [1].",0
"Symptoms usually develop over a few days and include polyuria, polydipsia, fatigue, nausea, weight loss, and decreased skin turgor.",0
Its pathophysiology is thought to result from increased degradation of arginine vasopressin (AVP) by a placental enzyme called vasopressinase.,0
The primary known action of vasopressinase is in vivo as well as in vitro degradation of vasopressin by removing amino acids from the N-terminus.,0
"Since the exogenous desmopressin is deaminated at the N-terminus, it can escape the degrading effect of the vasopressinase and is considered the treatment of choice in patients with gestational diabetes insipidus as demonstrated by Schrier [4].",0
"Vasopressinase is metabolized in the liver, which may explain higher concentrations of the enzyme in patients with fatty liver, hepatitis and preeclampsia as discussed by Barbey et al.",0
HELLP syndrome is considered a spectrum of preeclampsia.,0
"The pathophysiology is not well understood but has been hypothesized to result from excessive stimulation of V1 receptors by vasopressinase-altered AVP leading to platelet aggregation, vasospasm, endothelial constriction, and brain stimulation as discussed by Krege and Katz [6].",0
"On the other hand, liver dysfunction in patients with HELLP syndrome decreases the degradation of the vasopressinase as described by Ellidokuz et al.",0
"[""Therefore, it is possible that vasopressinase could have crossed the placenta thereby causing infant's hypernatremia and subsequently could have benefited from dDAVP.""]",0
"In light of the above case, we recommend maintaining a high index of suspicion of gestational diabetes insipidus in patients who present with typical symptoms and signs especially in the presence of other risk factors such as preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, and twin pregnancies.",0
"In addition, treating the infant with DDAVP besides intravenous fluids may also be beneficial.",0
It is related to excess vasopressinase enzyme activity which is metabolized in the liver.,0
"After many years of living next to the contamination and a litany of health problems she believes it caused, Bell-Jefferson and several other local families will have to vacate their homes for a third round of cleanup efforts by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).",0
"The EPA has mapped 521 abandoned uranium mines on the reservation, ranging from small holes dug by a single prospector into the side of a mesa to large commercial mining operations.1The Navajo people did not have a word for â€œradioactivityâ€ when mining outfits looking for vanadium2and uranium3began moving onto their land in the 1940s, and they did not understand that radiation could be dangerous.",0
"â€œBut what we will end up with is that we now will be able to study three successive generations of Navajos that have been exposed.â€\nAlthough the literature on chronic low-level uranium exposure is still quite small, by 2003 researchers knew that the dangers these exposures posed were due not to uraniumâ€™s radioactivity but to its chemical toxicity.24Both animal25and human26studies have found uranium to be primarily toxic to the kidneys.",0
"They were not told that the men who worked in the mines were breathing carcinogenic radon gas and showering in radioactive water, nor that the women washing their husbandsâ€™ work clothes could spread radionuclides to the rest of the familyâ€™s laundry.",0
"The investigators found signs of kidney damage that increased with higher daily intake of uranium in the drinking water.27\nUranium appears to exert its chemical effects on the kidneyâ€™s proximal tubules.28Arsenic and cadmiumâ€”which, along with other potentially hazardous metals, are sometimes found in uranium tailings29â€”create similar signatures of metal damage in the kidneys.30\nLewisâ€™s early data from the DiNEH Project suggest that self-reported kidney disease, hypertension, and autoimmune diseases were more prevalent among people who lived closer to mine waste sites.31Her colleague at the University of New Mexico, immunologist Ester Erdei, believes the increase in hypertension and autoimmune diseases might be connected to consumption of contaminated water.",0
"A growing body of evidence links hypertension,32heart disease,33and autoimmune diseases34to markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein and assorted chemokines.35Erdei hypothesizes that uranium exposure might contribute to these diseases through effects on inflammation.",0
"The spill dumped 94 million gallons of mill process effluent and 1,100 tons of tailingsâ€”an acidic, radioactive sludgeâ€”into a large arroyo that emptied into the Puerco River.4\nThe Church Rock spill occurred less than four months after the partial meltdown of the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor, and it released three times as much radiation, making it the biggest nuclear spill in U.S. history, yet it received only a tiny fraction of the news coverage.5Declared a Superfund site in 1983, the heaps of waste around the mill still cause radiation survey instruments to squeal from the invisible uranium atoms that remain active 30 years later.6\nâ€œThis area used to be my playground,â€ Bell-Jefferson says.",0
"She recently presented findings showing an association between increased levels of activated T cells in DiNEH Project participants and greater residential proximity to mine waste sites.36\nâ€œIf we see any of these activated T cells, we know that the immune system is highly reacting to something,â€ Erdei says.",0
â€œWe didnâ€™t know what it is.,0
This is the next step to find out how itâ€™s really happening on the molecular level.â€\n\nUraniumâ€™s Toxic Legacy\nHuman and animal studies elsewhere have indicated the health legacy of uranium exposure may extend to the children of exposed parents.,0
A study of 266 cases and matched controls among Navajo births over 18 years suggested that children of women who lived near abandoned uranium sites were 1.83 times more likely to have 1 of 33 selected defects.,0
"Among these were defects thought to be connected to radiation exposure (e.g., chromosomal disorders, single gene mutations) as well as distinctly nonrelated defects (e.g., deaths due to obstetrical complications).",0
"On the other hand, these outcomes also were twice as common among children whose mothers worked at an electronics assembly plant as in other children.37\nAnimal studies suggest potential reproductive implications of exposure.",0
A study in rats exposed to uranium found the offspring had a higher body burden of uranium than the dams.,0
"These offspring also had higher rates of physiological changes, including atypical sperm formation.38And a mouse study produced evidence that uranium in drinking water caused estrogenic activity even at levels below the EPA safe drinking water level of 30 Âµg/L.39\nTo look more closely at the effects of uranium exposure on human reproduction and development, Lewis has recently begun recruiting up to 1,500 pregnant women to participate in the Navajo Birth Cohort Study.40Besides tracking birth outcomes and infant development, pharmacologist Laurie Hudson of the University of New Mexico is looking at molecular changes that may be induced by exposure to uranium waste.",0
"This creates a hat trick of DNA damage: Uraniumâ€™s radioactive42and chemical43properties both can harm DNA, and the presence of arsenic may prevent cells from repairing the damage.",0
"Animal and cell culture studies have suggested a potential solution: zinc supplementation.44Hudson and Lewis want to see if zinc supplementation may prevent arsenic from damaging DNA repair enzymes in women enrolled in the Navajo Birth Cohort Study, and they have identified an easy way to do this.",0
"Prenatal vitamins, which contain zinc, are generally obtained via a prescription through the Indian Health Service.",0
"When corporate and government officials appeared in the spillâ€™s aftermath and began inquiring into exposure to the slurry and potential health problems, the Navajo people finally learned the truthâ€”far from being harmless, these uranium mines were poisoning people, and researchers say they will continue to do so for decades to come.",0
Women who donâ€™t take vitamins will serve as the control group.,0
"The investigators will have information on the womenâ€™s environmental exposures and their body burden of metals, so they can start to zero in on how arsenic and uranium exposures affect protein function and whether zinc supplementation provides any protection.",0
The findings will provide a concrete way for the researchers to give back to the community.,0
"â€œWeâ€™ve pretty much been clear from the beginning that if we see something thatâ€™s wrong, weâ€™re not going to let it stick around just to preserve the data,â€ Lewis says.",0
â€œWeâ€™re going to make sure people know their risks and can take action.â€\n\nPubMed Central:,0
"We thought we were very fortunate, but we were not told, â€˜Later on this will affect you in this way.â€™â€7\nYet researchers had noted as early as 1879 that uranium miners in Europe showed significantly elevated levels of lung cancer.8By the 1930s, they suspected radiation as the culprit.9As early as 1951, government scientists had begun to work out what made uranium so deadly.",0
"In 1995 former uranium miner George Tutt recollected, â€œWe were blessed, we thought.",0
"The answer, as it turned out, wasnâ€™t uranium itself but its decay products, including radium,10thorium,11and radon.12\nRadon is a gas, but with a half-life of four days, it rapidly decays into solid products, explains Doug Brugge, a professor of public health at Tufts University.13â€œBeing solids, these are going to want to stick to things like your lungs,â€ Brugge says.",0
"â€œBoth radon and its daughter products emit alpha particles, and this is a very effective way to cause damage that can lead to cancer.â€\nIn just over a decade, Navajo miners were being diagnosed with lung cancer,14a relatively rare disease in this largely nonsmoking population.15Beginning in 1950, workers with the U.S. Public Health Service led by Duncan Holaday and Victor Archer began following uranium miners in the Southwest, both Navajo and white, to measure their exposures and assess their specific cancer risks.",0
"To get access to the workers, the researchers had to strike a Faustian bargain with the mining companies: They could not inform the miners of the potential health hazards of their work.2Seeing it as the only way to convince government regulators to improve safety in the mines, the researchers accepted.16By 1965, the investigators reported an association between cumulative exposure to uranium and lung cancer among white miners and had definitively identified the cause as radiation exposure.17\nIn 1984 another team published results of a caseâ€“control study that further implicated uranium mining as a cause of lung cancer in Navajo men.",0
"Furthermore, the median age of miners with lung cancer was 44 years, compared with 63 years for nonminers with other cancers.18Decades after their exposure ended, standardized mortality ratios and relative risks for lung cancer and other respiratory problems were still nearly four times higher in Navajo miners than in nonminers.19\n\nCommunity Exposure to Uranium\nGetting the ore out of the ground was only the first step in a long process.",0
"Today, after decades of inactivity, the uranium from these ponds, waste and tailings piles, and the mines themselves is still present in highly chemically soluble forms6,21that have been leaching into the areaâ€™s drinking water, according to water testing by the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers.22\nIn a small, one-story adobe building tucked into the far edge of the University of New Mexico campus, Johnnye Lewis, a professor of toxicology, has spent more than a decade studying mining-related health effects in the Navajo people.",0
"The DiNEH (DinÃ© Network for Environmental Health) Project was originally started to address community concerns about the high rate of kidney disease in this population, which some community leaders and health professionals suspected was related to drinking contaminated water.",0
The data the team amassed over the last 13 years suggests that health problems from these mines in fact arenâ€™t limited to the miners who worked in them but also extend to those exposed through drinking water or simply living near a mine.,0
Nutritional knowledge as a determinant of vitamin and mineral supplementation during pregnancy\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nPregnancy is a critical period for both woman and baby from a nutritional perspective.,0
"Nutritional education is considered an important tool for promoting a healthy lifestyle, but has not been studied as a determinant for maternal use of supplements during pregnancy, especially in Romania, where evidence about pregnancy and nutrition is scarce.",0
"More frequent use of supplements during pregnancy was found to be associated with a higher socio-economic status, higher level of education and use of prenatal medical services in studies conducted in Finland [15], the United Kingdom [16], the United States of America [17], Denmark [18] and Tanzania [19].",0
"One study conducted in Poland concluded that the level of nutritional knowledge of pregnant women regarding mineral and vitamins was insufficient, without focusing on the relationship with their intake [20].",0
Another study showed that a higher level of nutritional knowledge was associated with vitamin/mineral supplementation use [21].,0
"In Romania it is not clear whether there is a relationship between socio-demographic factors or the level of nutritional knowledge and the use of iron, folic acid and multivitamins in pregnancy.",0
"The aim of this study was to assess the determinants of the use of folic acid, iron and multivitamins supplements by expectant mothers in Romania, in terms of nutritional knowledge evaluated by a structured questionnaire, socio-demographic factors and engagement with prenatal care.",0
"We excluded stillbirths, those who declined to participate, those with obstetric pathology, or psychiatric, cognitive or other disease that might adversely affect understanding of the study objectives or the ability to provide accurate information.",0
"Those who did not complete the interview were recorded as having refused to participate and were taken into account when calculating the refusal rate, but excluded from the final analysis.",0
"We selected a 95% confidence level and an assumed prevalence of supplement use of 50%, informed by other studies [15-19,22], due to the lack of prior data in our region.",0
"Owing to the lack of other available data, we used the annual number of live births in IaÅŸi county reported on 01 July 2009 (n\u2009=\u20099,499) to define the size of the reference group [23].",0
"Based on these calculations, the minimum sample size required was 370.",0
"Development and validation of the nutritional knowledge questionnaire\nTo evaluate nutritional knowledge we developed a questionnaire based on the recommendations of the â€œPregnancy Notebookâ€ [24] and â€œThe Principles of the Childâ€™s and Motherâ€™s Diet: Guidelines for Health Providers at Community Levelâ€ [25], educational tools developed by the Ministry of Health in Romania.",0
"This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between nutritional knowledge and the use of folic acid, iron and multivitamin supplements during pregnancy and to assess the influence of socio-demographic factors and prenatal care.",0
"Construction validity was also found to be satisfactory (ANOVA F statistic\u2009=\u200939.9, p\u2009<\u2009.001), and post hoc testing revealed statistically significant differences between the mean score of the questionnaire according to each category of formal education (4.9 for 1â€“4\xa0years of formal education; 8.35 for 5â€“8\xa0years of education; 10.8 for 9â€“12\xa0years of education; and 13.7 for more than 12\xa0years; p\u2009<\u2009.001).",0
"Results\nWe found that 48.0% of participants used folic acid, 45.3% used iron supplements and 68.0% used multivitamins during pregnancy (Table\xa01).",0
"Factors associated with vitamin and mineral supplementation during pregnancy\nAge, level of education, being married and low gestational age at the first prenatal check-up and total number of prenatal medical visits were positively associated with the use of folic acid, iron and multivitamin supplements.",0
"Significant differences were noted in the use of folic acid and multivitamin supplements, but not in the use of iron supplements, depending on area of residence (rural versus urban) and parity.",0
"The same relationship was observed for women with 9â€“12\xa0years of formal education regarding folic acid use (p\u2009<\u2009.001), iron (p\u2009=\u2009.001) and multivitamins (p\u2009<\u2009.001).",0
"When analysing separately the interaction effect between education and prenatal care, the probability of using folic acid, iron and vitamins supplements was increasing with the level of formal education and number of prenatal visits (Table\xa04).",0
"After adjusting for the total number of prenatal visits, we noted independent effects of area of residence and level of education on the use of supplements: women from urban areas and those with more than 9\xa0years of formal education were more likely to have used folic acid (urban area: aOR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.5; 9â€“12\xa0years of education: aOR, 4.8; 95% CI, 2.3-10.0; >12\xa0years of school: aOR, 8.1; 95% CI, 3.7-18.0) and multivitamin supplements (urban area: aOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0-2.7; >12\xa0years of school: aOR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.7-7.4) (Table\xa05).",0
However these socio-demographic factors were not independent determinants of the use of iron supplements.,0
Women who stated that they had received dietary or breastfeeding advice had a higher probability of using folic acid or multivitamins regardless of the number of prenatal visits.,0
"Early pregnancy registration was significantly associated with the intake of folic acid (aOR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.2-11.9).",0
"Primiparous women were more likely to use multivitamins regardless of the number of prenatal visits (aOR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.7).",0
"Making more than four prenatal visits was also associated with folic acid, iron and multivitamin supplements intake, a positive association that persisted after adjusting for socio-demographic factors (Table\xa05).",0
"Anaemia during pregnancy is a public health problem that affects both developed and developing countries and has an impact not only on health providers, but also on the socio-economic environment [12].",0
"There is also evidence of a relationship between engagement with prenatal care and use of multivitamin supplements, the adequacy of prenatal care being assessed according to Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilisation Index, which takes into account the month of initiation of care and the proportion of recommended visits adjusted for the gestational age at initiation of care and gestational age at delivery [27].",0
"An above average level of nutritional knowledge was significantly associated with the use of supplements, regardless of the number of prenatal consultations, age, area of residence or formal education (Table\xa05), but also when the interaction effect of prenatal care and formal education together was taken into consideration (Table\xa04).",0
"Nutritional knowledge was significantly associated with the intake of these supplements, regardless of the frequency of prenatal visits or socio-demographic characteristics.",0
"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to have examined the factors that influence use of vitamin and mineral supplements during pregnancy in Eastern Europe.",0
The use of supplements during pregnancy varies widely between countries.,0
These differences cannot be compared directly due to discrepancies in national guidelines and the financial barriers in some regions [27].,0
"Routine use of iron supplements is common, as it is difficult to ensure adequate intake from food sources, even from those with relatively high iron bioavailability [29,30].",0
The Institute of Medicine recommends a daily intake of 400\xa0Î¼g of folic acid and 30\xa0mg of iron during the second and third trimesters [31].,0
"Vitamin and mineral supplements are recommended for women with multiple pregnancy, those who misuse alcohol or drugs, or have an unbalanced diet [32].",0
The World Health Organization recommends a daily intake of 60\xa0mg iron and 400\xa0Î¼g folic acid for six months to prevent anaemia [33].,0
"Romanian recommendations stipulate that women with a haemoglobin higher than 11\xa0g/dl should take 60\xa0mg of iron and 350\xa0Î¼g of folic acid from the 16thweek of pregnancy to prevent anaemia, but only iron products are reimbursed by the health insurance system.",0
"To prevent neural tube defects, 400\xa0Î¼g of folic acid should be taken daily, starting one month before conception and throughout the first trimester.",0
The routine use of multivitamins is not recommended [34].,0
"We evaluated the determinants for the intake of multivitamins as previous studies, as well as the common practice in Romania suggested a high incidence of use [14,35], despite the lack of recommendation.",0
"We found that 48.0% of women took folic acid at some stage during pregnancy, compared with 27.0% in the IOMC study.",0
This may have arisen as a consequence of the IOMC study only examining folic acid use during the last trimester of pregnancy [14].,0
"The proportion of women in our study group taking folic acid is still low, despite its widely recognised benefits, but could be explained by the lack of reimbursement for the cost of folic acid, which must be bought over the counter at any time it is prescribed, during pregnancy or before conception.",0
"Above-average nutritional knowledge was independently associated with the use of folic acid (aOR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.6-13.8), iron (aOR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2-5.7) and multivitamins (aOR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.2-6.8).",0
The reported adherence rates to folic acid intake in other countries vary depending on concomitant recommendations for cereal fortification and on the period analysed â€“ pre- or peri-conception.,0
In a meta-analysis undertaken by Pena-Rosas et al.,0
"[32], the proportion of women taking folic acid varies between 0.9% and 49% before conception and between 0.5% and 52% in the peri-conception period.",0
"Our results lie within these ranges, but it is difficult to make a comparison, as the variations are very wide and we recorded the use of folic acid throughout pregnancy without focusing on the first trimester.",0
"It could be argued that as routine prenatal care in Romania does not usually begin until after the first trimester is almost ended, including advice about folic acid as part of prenatal care is redundant as the neural tube has fully developed within 28\xa0days of conception [9].",0
"Nonetheless, folic acid supplementation might address other forms of anaemia, and the advice might also increase the likelihood of folic acid use before and during future pregnancies.",0
"The use of folic acid was independently associated with a higher level of formal education (aOR, 5.2; 95% CI, 2.1-12.8) and an early start in prenatal care (aOR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.0-11.1).",0
"Among the factors evaluated in our study, area of residence, level of education and marital status were associated with the intake of folic acid during pregnancy, independently of the number of prenatal visits.",0
This observation could be a consequence of social inequity or particular health beliefs.,0
"The number of prenatal visits, registration with a physician early in pregnancy and the level of nutritional knowledge were independently associated with the use of folic acid, after adjusting for socio-demographic factors, suggesting that educational interventions could play an important role in promoting the use of folic acid supplements.",0
The observation that early registration with a physician in pregnancy was associated with folic acid intake could indicate the recognised importance of early prenatal care.,0
"Furthermore, it is perhaps unsurprising that women with higher educational achievement and also those with greater engagement with prenatal care had better nutritional knowledge and used supplements more.",0
"Importantly, we also found that less well-educated women who engaged with prenatal care were more likely to take folic acid.",0
"Women with a higher education (aOR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1-4.9), more than 10 prenatal visits (aOR, 7.2; 95% CI, 3.4-15.0) and those who received advice on breastfeeding (aOR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.5) were more likely to use iron during pregnancy.",0
"This suggests that the interventions (prenatal visits) are productive, and that the Romanian government should seek ways of encouraging less well-educated women to participate.",0
Some of our findings are comparable with those of studies conducted in other countries.,0
"Low adherence with advice about supplements was associated with unwanted pregnancy, low maternal age and low economic status in the United Kingdom [36], unplanned pregnancy and lack of education regarding the role of folic acid in South Korea [37].",0
"The impact of nutritional knowledge on the use of folic acid was emphasised in a study conducted in Turkey, where factors negatively associated with pre-conception supplementation were low socio-economic status, age below 30\xa0years, low levels of education and unplanned pregnancy.",0
"The same study stressed that the level of knowledge about food sources and the role of folic acid during pregnancy was influenced by socio-demographic factors, especially the level of education [38].",0
"Similar results were found when analysing the contributing factors for the use of multivitamins: more than 12\xa0years of schooling (aOR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.4-7.9) and appropriate prenatal care (aOR, 9.4; 95% CI, 4.5-19.5).",0
"In our study, the level of nutritional knowledge was an independent determinant for the use of folic acid during pregnancy.",0
"A relatively low proportion of women in our study used iron supplements (45.3%), although these are provided free of charge to women after the 16thweek of pregnancy.",0
A previous study in Romania reported that supplemental iron was taken by 53.3% of women during pregancy [14].,0
"A Danish study reported that adherence with an iron supplementation regime was associated with maternal age (over 20\xa0years), primiparity and educational level [18].",0
"These results are similar to ours: we found that women aged over 18\xa0years, with parity less than two, with more than 9\xa0years of education, from urban areas with a wanted pregnancy or who were married were significantly more likely to use iron supplements.",0
"After adjusting for socio-demographic factors, more than four prenatal visits and level of nutritional knowledge remained associated with iron supplementation.",0
"This highlights the importance of prenatal care, both in terms of frequency and content, in improving adherence to programs to prevent anaemia.",0
"Multivitamins were used by 68% of the women in our study, comparable with the 60% reported by the IOMC study [14].",0
"This is a surprisingly high proportion, especially when there is no strong recommendation for the use of multivitamins in Romania or internationally.",0
"Moreover, reimbursement for multivitamin supplements is not covered by insurance in Romania, suggesting that there are other factors contributing to their use.",0
"Some studies describe a positive association between the use of multivitamins during pregnancy and certain socio-demographic characteristics, such as age [15,16,18,20], education [15,17,18,36,39] and marital status [17]; but others have reported an inverse relation between education and the use of multivitamins [27].",0
Conclusions\nLevel of nutritional knowledge has a strong independent association with the use of supplements during pregnancy.,0
"This index is not recorded in Romania; instead, we evaluated engagement in prenatal care according to Ministry of Health recommendations, which refer to the total number of prenatal consultations and time of initiation of care.",0
"The content of prenatal care, including nutritional education, is an important factor that could determine the use of supplements during pregnancy, but women may also receive advice from friends, family, the media and other sources.",0
"In our study, women who scored at least â€œmediumâ€ in the nutritional knowledge questionnaire were more likely to use multivitamins.",0
"Thus, even though there is no consensus on recommending the use of multivitamins during pregnancy, they are used more often by those women with a better socio-economic status, with a higher level of education and who attended more prenatal consultations.",0
"Other studies show that factors associated with multivitamin supplementation during pregnancy are schooling level [15,40] and age [28].",0
"Background\nAdequate nutrition during pregnancy is associated with optimal foetal growth [1,2], normal pregnancy duration [3] and a decrease in the risk of congenital abnormalities [4].",0
The results of the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) also emphasize the role of income and marital status in the use of vitamin and mineral supplements [40].,0
"In our study, after adjusting for the number of prenatal consultations, the only socio-demographic factors that persisted on being associated with the use of multivitamins during pregnancy were: area of residence; level of education; parity and receipt of advice about diet and breastfeeding.",0
"This might suggest the existence of social inequities and the influence of economic factors in making health-related decisions, as in our country, women in the urban area, more educated and with less children are usually having a better financial status.",0
"After adjusting for socio-demographic factors, making more than four prenatal consultations remained associated with the use of multivitamin supplements.",0
"A lack of vitamins and minerals can adversely influence the newbornâ€™s weight, even if the dietary intake of proteins and energy is adequate [5,6].",0
"These supplements are not necessary in most pregnancies, which raises questions about womenâ€™s motivation to use them in the absence of formal recommendations.",0
"Level of nutritional knowledge was associated with the use of multivitamins regardless of the number of prenatal visits, age, area of residence and level of education, which could suggest that the decision to use them depends on other factors, such as attitudes towards pregnancy or beliefs about the importance of vitamins during pregnancy, areas that warrant further study.",0
"Limitations\nThis study is based on retrospectively self-reported data, which could have led to an underestimation of the use of supplements, especially folic acid [27].",0
We mitigated against this possible source of error by asking additional questions about the type of supplement and its commercial name.,0
"This was the first use of a newly developed questionnaire, which we administered 2â€“3\xa0days after delivery, to include women who may not have engaged with prenatal care.",0
"Having done so, however, some of our participants may not have accurately remembered their use of supplements early in pregnancy or before conception.",0
"Even though our results highlight the importance of nutritional knowledge in the decision to use iron or folic acid, we cannot draw conclusions about overall compliance with supplement regimes, because we did not record the dose or duration of iron, folic acid or multivitamin use.",0
"Furthermore, we did not record when during the pregnancy the supplements were taken, which is of particular importance for folic acid.",0
"The sample size of our study was determined based on an unknown prevalence of supplements intake (which was set by default to be 50%), but may have been too small to accommodate some subgroup analyses; we must therefore be cautious about the conclusions that can be drawn from subgroup analysis and test the hypotheses that arise from these findings in future studies.",0
"The results of several meta-analyses reinforce the beneficial role of iron and folic acid supplements during pregnancy in reducing the prevalence of neural tube defects, low-birth weight babies, small for gestational age newborns and maternal anaemia [7-9].",0
"As this is an observational study, we cannot conclude that the information about the roles or sources of nutrients or general recommendations about diet during pregnancy directly influence the frequency with which supplements are used, despite the fact that nutritional knowledge appears to be an important determinant.",0
Additional studies are required better to understand womenâ€™s attitudes towards using supplements and the way nutritional knowledge is delivered and used.,0
"Conclusions\nThe level of nutritional knowledge was significantly and independently associated with iron, folic acid and multivitamin supplements use during pregnancy.",0
"Engagement with prenatal care appeared to increase the likelihood that less well-educated women would take supplements during pregnancy, suggesting that the prenatal nutritional advice may be a useful intervention.",0
"Some cross-sectional studies show the same positive results for the use of multivitamins [10], but there is still debate as to whether these are superior to iron and folic acid [11].",0
"From a public health perspective, this is crucially important, and should motivate more effective implementation of nutritional educational programmes for women of childbearing age.",0
"Prevention strategies for iron deficiency and maternal anaemia include nutritional education, promoting the intake of iron and folic acid supplements, and food fortification [13].",0
"Daily use of iron supplements is effective when administered under supervision in clinical interventional trials, but is less so in public health programmes because of difficulty engaging with the target population.",0
"Lack of engagement may be a consequence of insufficient involvement of policy makers, issues regarding distribution and costs and difficulties in training the educators, or the beliefs and cultural practices of the target population and the characteristics and side effects of supplements [11,14].",0
"In Romania, a study conducted by the Alfred Rusescu Institute of Motherâ€™s and Childâ€™s Care (IOMC), found that the use of iron supplements during pregnancy in Romania only reduced the incidence of anaemia at birth by 5% even when iron supplements were provided free of charge under reimbursement arrangements from 16\xa0weeks of gestation, and treatment was supervised by primary care physicians [14].",0
"Several studies emphasize the importance of the relationship between iron, folic acid or multivitamin intake and socio-demographic factors such as age, level of education, area of residence, marital status, parity, economical status and characteristics of prenatal care (including gestational age at the beginning of prenatal care and the number of prenatal consultations) [15-19].",0
"Translation of a gestational diabetes nutrition model of care into practice: results from an implementation project\n\nBackground\nReduced need for insulin therapy in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) has been documented in a study validating American Nutrition Practice Guidelines, which recommend at least 3 dietitian visits.",0
No Australian GDM Nutrition Practice Guidelines exist and systematic delivery of dietetic care to women with GDM does not occur in Australia.,0
This paper evaluates a theory-informed implementation plan to translate a dietetic model of care based on the American guidelines in an Australian maternity hospital.,0
Results\nBoth phases only ran for 7 months; integration required 4 months.,0
"Pre-intervention, only one of the 91 women with GDM seen received â‰¥ 1 dietetic follow-up appointment.",0
"However, due to heavy clinical demand, only 31.5 % of the 162 women seen after the change in practice received best-practice individual dietitian review at their first visit.",0
Clinically-relevant trends were seen in changes in medication requirements; the percentage of women requiring pharmacologic treatment decreased from 31.1% to 26.9%.,0
"Only a small change in glycemic index of womenâ€™s diet occurred after seeing a dietitian, pre- to post- implementation (-2.0 Â± 4.4 vs. -3.0 Â± 5.0).",0
Service limitations impaired the delivery of optimal care.,0
Partial adherence to the model of care may have attenuated changes in medication requirements and dietary patterns.,0
Full adherence may have resulted in even greater changes.,0
"Anaphylaxis associated with folic acid: domestic case review\n\nBackground\nSynthetic folic acid has been shown to cause serious, potentially life-threatening IgE mediated anaphylaxis [1-3].",0
There was insufficient case information available to assess any causal association between the allergic reaction and the fetal loss.,0
"Three medically important cases involved pharmaceutical doses of folic acid (5 mg), one of which was a pediatric case involving a multi ingredient intravenous total parental nutrition product (Multi-12/K1 pediatric) containing folic acid.",0
Conclusions\nFolic acid allergy appears to be rare and would not be expected to be well known among health providers or consumers.,0
Increasing awareness amongst health providers regarding folic acid allergy may improve the identification and counselling of patients with this allergy.,0
Results\nAll 15 cases of anaphylaxis involved multi ingredient products with NHP doses (up to and including 1 mg).,0
"One case of anaphylaxis and 3 cases of serious allergic reaction involved women taking prenatal supplements, two of which reported spontaneous abortion.",0
"Brown adipose tissue activity as a target for the treatment of obesity/insulin resistance\n\nAbstract\nPresence of brown adipose tissue (BAT), characterized by the expression of the thermogenic uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), has recently been described in adult humans.",0
"Conversely, several studies in both rodents and humans have shown that BAT activation (by cold exposure, Î²3-agonist treatment, transplantation and others) improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity.",0
"Interestingly, BAT glucose uptake is close to the values observed for metastasis in cancer in humans (Aukema et al.,2010).",0
"To investigate the role of BAT, of UCP1 in particular, studies were carried out in UCP1 knockout mice.",0
"Surprisingly, no particular phenotype was noted in these mice when they were kept at 23Â°C, except for their increased cold sensitivity (Enerback et al.,1997; Kontani et al.,2005).",0
"Altogether, the existing literature suggests that BAT activation is not only involved in non-shivering thermogenesis, but also in the regulation of insulin-mediated glucose disposal.",0
Whether brown and brite adipocytes display some degree of specialization with regard to these different functions has to be established.,0
"The aims of this review are to describe some of the main factors regulating UCP1 activity in brown and brite adipocytes, as well as to discuss the potential role of UCP1 activation for the treatment of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes associated with obesity.",0
"Interestingly, similar results were obtained by adipose tissue-specific overexpression of PR-domain-containing 16 (PRDM16) or BMP4 in mice.",0
"Factors affecting BAT function and energy metabolism improve overall metabolism\nIn rodents, brown adipocytes are found in discrete areas, such as interscapular, cervical, peri-aortic, peri-renal, intercostal and mediastinal depots (Cinti,2001), which are referred to as â€œclassicalâ€ BAT depots.",0
"In contrast, â€œbriteâ€ adipocytes have been shown to originate from Myf-negative ( Myf 5âˆ’) progenitor cells, much like white adipocytes (Petrovic et al.,2010; Long et al.,2014).",0
"Whether â€œbriteâ€ adipocytes descend from unique precursors, or share progenitors with either white or classic brown adipocytes still remains to be established (for rev., see Chechi et al.,2013).",0
"Interestingly, the â€œbrowningâ€ of WAT (i.e., increased proportion of brown adipocytes) may also involve transdifferentiation of white-to-brown adipose cells (Smorlesi et al.,2012; Frontini et al.,2013), although this issue is still a matter of debate (Wu et al.,2012).",0
"The mediators of such beneficial effects seem to include FGF21, interleukin-6, BMP8B and prostaglandin D2 synthase.",0
"Whatever their developmental origin, white, â€œbriteâ€ and brown adipocytes seem to greatly differ in their function.",0
"Moreover, the role of BAT activation appears to be broader than solely the promotion of negative energy balance (for rev., see Peirce and Vidal-Puig,2013).",0
"Indeed, BAT is now known to exert anti-type 2 diabetic effects associated with improvments of dyslipidemia and insulin secretion as well as decrease insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes (de Souza et al.,1997; Liu et al.,1998; Frontini et al.,2013; Peirce and Vidal-Puig,2013).",0
"However, as these different cells are often mixed, such as occurs for classical and â€œbriteâ€ adipocytes in some human depots (Wu et al.,2012; Cypess et al.,2013; Jespersen et al.,2013), only the use of specific cell surface markers (i.e., ASC-1, PAT2, and P2RX5 for white, â€œbriteâ€ and brown adipocytes, respectively) will allow for their identification, as well as for the precise understanding of their respective therapeutic properties (Ussar et al.,2014).",0
"The main mediators of such beneficial effects seem to include fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), interleukin-6 (IL-6), bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) and prostaglandin D2 synthase.",0
"Interestingly, some of these molecules, called batokines, can be secreted by BAT itself, indicating the occurrence of autocrine effects.",0
"Interestingly, in humans, a mild cold exposure (12 h to 19Â°C) was recently shown to increase the diurnal plasma FGF21 levels, with a positive correlation with the changes in adipose tissue microdialysate glycerol and total energy expenditure (Lee et al.,2013).",0
"Interestingly, some of these molecules can be secreted by BAT itself, indicating the occurrence of autocrine effects.",0
"This suggested that FGF21 could play a similar role in humans as in rodents in promoting cold-induced metabolic changes (i.e., lipolysis and cold-induced thermogenesis).",0
"In adipose tissue, it appears that PPARÎ³ transcriptionally controls FGF21, which then acts as an autocrine or paracrine way to increase PPARÎ³ transcriptional activity in a feed-forward loop system (Wang et al.,2008; Dutchak et al.,2012).",0
"Altogether, these observations suggest that FGF21 may be a key factor linking UCP1 expression to improved glucose metabolism.",0
"It may also exert determinant developmental effects, given the observation that the postnatal maturation of BAT appears to relate to the onset of feeding and initiation of hepatic function, as mediated by the release of FGF21 (Hondares et al.,2010).",0
"In addition, it was recently proposed that FGF21 could act within the central nervous system, both at the level of the hypothalamus and the hindbrain to promote a set of responses that occur during starvation (i.e.",0
"This raises the possibility that, in contrast to its beneficial effects on peripheral metabolism, FGF21 may exert deleterious effects by acting centrally.",0
"Several studies implicated IL-6 as a co-inducer of the development of obesity-associated insulin resistance preceding the onset of type 2 diabetes (Pal et al.,2014).",0
"This is in keeping with the observation of increased plasma IL-6 levels in obese patients (Cottam et al.,2004).",0
"In such patients, IL-6 is preferentially secreted from visceral rather than from subcutaneous adipocytes and may participate in the prevailing increase in sympathetic outflow by exerting central effects (Wallenius et al.,2002; Fain et al.,2004).",0
"Paradoxically, central IL-6 delivery was shown to suppress weight gain and visceral obesity, without affecting food intake (Li et al.,2002).",0
"Interestingly, chronic central IL-6 stimulation desensitized IL-6 signal transduction characterized by reversal of elevated pSTAT3 levels (Li et al.,2002).",0
"Such desensitization is likely occurring in situations of chronic elevation in IL-6 levels, such as occurs in human obesity.",0
"It should be added that the understanding of the role of IL-6 is more complex, as this cytokine is known to be secreted by skeletal muscle in response to exercise, exerting insulin sensitizing effects (Kelly et al.,2004; Petersen and Pedersen,2005).",0
"Along this line, it was recently shown that BAT transplantation into the abdominal cavity of high fat diet-induced obese mice was able to improve their glucose tolerance, increase their insulin sensitivity, lower their body weight, decrease their fat mass and completely reverse their insulin resistance (Stanford et al.,2013).",0
"Importantly, the improved metabolic profile was lost when BAT used for transplantation came from IL-6 knockout mice, clearly demonstrating that BAT-derived IL-6 is required for the profound effects of BAT transplantation on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity (Stanford et al.,2013).",0
"However, the existence of this protein and its role in humans is still a matter of debate (Elsen et al.,2014a).",0
Stimulation of BAT activity and/or recruitment of UCP1-positive cells are therefore relevant targets for the treatment of obesity/type 2 diabetes in humans.,0
"In both rodents and humans, this BA-D2-UCP1 pathway appears to be crucial for the fine-tuning of energy homeostasis, improving the metabolic control (Watanabe et al.,2006).",0
"The Î± isoform was shown to regulate adaptive thermogenesis, whereas the Î² isoform appears to modulate UCP1 expression, without increasing thermogenesis (Ribeiro et al.,2001).",0
"Thirty months after the initial treatment of the thyroid cancer (radioiodine and levothyroxine), remarkable improvements in glycemia were noted and the anti-diabetic treatment could even be discontinued.",0
"Interestingly, increased FDG uptake was also noted in the subcutaneous fat, in particular in the pelvic area and over the lower extremities.",0
"Overall, the sequence of events in this patient suggests that the metabolic and trophic effects of THs on BAT may play a critical role in non-insulin-mediated glucose utilization, ultimately leading to near-normal glucose levels (Skarulis et al.,2010).",0
"Introduction\nObesity, well known to be associated with a number of comorbidities, including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, has become a major public health problem in recent decades, and has reached epidemic proportions, not only in high-income countries, but also in most middle-income societies.",0
"They were originally thought to be factors inducing bone formation, but were then described to be involved in the development and function of many tissues, such as the intestine, brain and WAT (Hogan,1996).",0
"Some members of the BMP family were shown to play a role in energy homeostasis and the early steps of adipogenesis, in particular.",0
"Among the 20 BMP family members, BMP-7 has been implicated in the development of BAT, being able to drive the complete brown fat differentiation program, including PRDM16 expression (Modica and Wolfrum,2013).",0
"BMP-7 can also affect energy homeostasis by acting on mature brown adipocytes, resulting in the induction of UCP1, thereby enhancing thermogenesis.",0
"As it is not expressed in mature brown adipocytes, BMP7 appears to exert its action on BAT as an endocrine factor.",0
"In addition to its effect on BAT, BMP-7 was also reported to induce the â€œbrowningâ€ of WAT and to improve insulin sensitivity (Schulz et al.,2011).",0
"Finally, several hypothalamic nuclei were shown to express BMP-7, suggesting that it may regulate BAT function via a central mechanism, also responsible for decreased food intake (Modica and Wolfrum,2013).",0
"However, in primary human adipose stem cells, both BMP4 and BMP7 induced a white-to-brown adipocyte transdifferentiation (Elsen et al.,2014b), pointing to the occurrence of different effects, depending on the model used for investigation.",0
Further studies are needed to clarify and strengthen the role of BMP proteins in the regulation of BAT or â€œbriteâ€ cells and their consequences on metabolic homeostasis.,0
"Activation of AKT is known to trigger a complex cascade of events that include the inhibition of FOXO transcription factors (Ortega-Molina et al.,2012).",0
"Interestingly, mice carrying additional copies of Pten (Ptentgmice) are not only protected from cancer and exhibit extended longevity, but, according to the authors, they also present enhanced energy expenditure that participates in counteracting the development of obesity.",0
"This is related to lower BAT levels of phosphorylated AKT and FOXO1, higher BAT and WAT expression of UCP1, as well as of its transcriptional regulator, PGC1-Î± (Ortega-Molina et al.,2012).",0
Excess weight is usually defined by the body mass index or BMI.,0
"â€œBrowningâ€ of WAT could be one of the mechanisms underlying the increased insulin sensitivity of LPTENKO mice, in keeping with the observation of increased WAT glucose uptake (Peyrou et al.,2015).",0
"In humans, PTEN haploinsufficiency was shown to have divergent effects, as they increase the risk of obesity, while decreasing that of type 2 diabetes by markedly improving insulin sensitivity (Pal et al.,2012).",0
"In a very recent study, the grizzly bear was used as a hibernation model, in which obesity is a natural adaptation to survive months of fasting (Nelson et al.,2014).",0
It was remarkably observed that preparation for hibernation was characterized by striking increases in body weight and in fat mass.,0
Different approaches were used to delineate the impact of UCP1 on insulin sensitivity.,0
The modification of insulin sensitivity occurs via the effect of the PTEN/AKT-mediated regulation of adipose tissue lipolysis.,0
"These results support the notion that adipose tissue is very insulin sensitive in the fed state, while being able to drive insulin resistance in the fasting state, independently from insulin levels (Nelson et al.,2014).",0
"In humans, the only physiological recovery of insulin sensitivity after a period of insulin resistance, partially due to an increase in food intake and lipogenesis, is observed in women after pregnancy (Barbour et al.,2007).",0
?,0
indicates the existence of conflicting data in the literature with regard to the impact of the factor on UCP1 activity.,0
"Impact of perinatal nutritional changes\nEpidemiological evidence in humans strongly suggests that the intrauterine and early postnatal environments have a significant long-term influence on body weight and energy homeostasis in offspring (for rev., see Breton,2013).",0
"Thus, both maternal underfeeding or overfeeding were reported to exert a predisposing effect for the development of later obesity (Breton,2013).",0
The signals that mediate the effects of maternal metabolic disorders in overfed offspring have not been fully identified.,0
"They include hormones, such as insulin, leptin and glucocorticoids, proinflammatory cytokines, as well as complex epigenetic modifications (Tamashiro and Moran,2010; Lukaszewski et al.,2013).",0
"In this context, the sheep appears to be a very good model, because as for humans, the major source of BAT in the fetus is around central organs and is replaced by WAT after birth, whereas in rodents, the primary BAT depot is interscapular and it remains throughout life (Symonds et al.,2012).",0
"[""In sheep, the mother's diet during pregnancy determines the size of the placenta and can affect both the BAT and WAT mass, depending on the timing and the nature of the diet perturbation.""]",0
"In other words, the respective growth of the BAT and WAT depots depends on the maternal diet during gestation and it may be responsible for the development of obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in the offspring, later in life (Symonds et al.,2012).",0
"However, in a recent study, the role of diabetes during gestation on such adverse long-term metabolic consequences has been seriously questioned, as they seem to relate more on known confounders, such as the BMI of either one of the parents (Donovan and Cundy,2014).",0
"More than the total body weight, the distribution of the stored fat is of importance for the development of obesity and its comorbidities.",0
"Among the regulators that may link the maternal diet during gestation with the metabolic outcome of the offspring, leptin is one of the main candidates.",0
"Rodent models of leptin deficiency exhibit marked decreases in BAT thermogenic capacity, as well as activity (Ueno et al.,1998).",0
"Moreover, it was shown that leptin injection in the early stage of life in lambs decreases UCP1 expression in BAT, but improves thermoregulation, suggesting a particular role of leptin at such a stage in life in large mammals (Mostyn et al.,2002).",0
"Another study revealed that the ability of leptin to increase the metabolic rate early in life is independent from its anorectic action (Mistry et al.,1999).",0
"No data are available as yet with regard to the impact of early leptin administration on the subsequent â€œbrowningâ€ of WAT and the related regulation of glucose metabolism, as well as the response to hypercaloric diets later in life in the offspring.",0
"Attempts at stimulating BAT function in humans\nWith regard to the relationship between BAT and body weight in humans, an inverse correlation between BMI and the amount of BAT was described, already 5 years ago (Cypess et al.,2009; van Marken Lichtenbelt et al.,2009).",0
"In addition, more recent studies indicated that, compared to individuals without BAT, the BAT-positive subjects were younger, had lower body mass index, fasting insulin, insulin resistance, but a greater level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (Zhang et al.,2013).",0
"A parallel increase in BAT activity and cold-induced energy expenditure was also observed in response to acute cold exposure in subjects with low BAT activity, demonstrating the possible occurrence of BAT recruitment in humans (Yoneshiro et al.,2013).",0
"Very recently, chronic cold acclimation in human subjects was reported to increase the volume of metabolically active BAT, increasing its oxidative capacity, therefore its contribution to cold-induced thermogenesis (Blondin et al.,2014).",0
"In another study, the cold-induced increase in thermogenesis was accompanied by a decrease in body weight, mainly affecting the fat mass compartment (Yoneshiro et al.,2013).",0
"Thus, central or visceral obesity, in which fat accumulates in the trunk and in the abdominal cavity (in the mesentery and around the viscera), is associated with a much higher risk for several diseases than excess subcutaneous fat accumulation.",0
"These results are in keeping with data showing a physiological role of BAT in whole-body energy expenditure, glucose homeostasis, and insulin sensitivity in humans during prolonged cold exposure (Chondronikola et al.,2014).",0
Much more work is needed to identify other ways than cold exposure to increase BAT activity in obese subjects.,0
"Indeed, resistance to the development of obesity has at least partly been attributed to elevated recruitment of brown adipocytes in skeletal muscle or WAT (Guerra et al.,1998; Almind et al.,2007; Veyrat-Durebex et al.,2009; Harms and Seale,2013).",0
"These studies are highly therapeutically relevant, as BAT activation in overweight or obese subjects will activate thermogenesis and dissipate heat, while at the same time improving glucose metabolism and insulin resistance.",0
"It should be added at that point that, although Î²3 adrenoceptors are expressed in humans (for rev., see Mund and Frishman,2013) and Î²3 agonists are potent UCP1 activators in rodents, the molecules which are active in rodents cannot be used in humans due to inter-species differences.",0
"Obesity has profound effects on tissue insulin sensitivity, and therefore on systemic glucose homeostasis.",0
"This should be solved in the future by the identification of selective human Î²3 agonists (Mund and Frishman,2013; Bordicchia et al.,2014).",0
"Conclusion\nTo conclude, UCP1 is an excellent target to struggle diabetes and decrease body fat mass, improving whole metabolism.",0
"Finding a molecule with as much efficiency as the Î²3 agonist in rodents, would be of considerable therapeutic relevance for the treatment of obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in humans.",0
"Insulin resistance is present even in simple obesity, without hyperglycemia, indicating a fundamental abnormality of insulin signaling in states of excess adipose tissue mass.",0
"The epidemiologic association of obesity, particularly of the visceral type, with type 2 diabetes has been recognized for decades.",0
"According to the World Health Organization, 347 millions of people are diabetic in the world, and it is predicted that in 2030, diabetes will be the 7th cause of death considering the worldwide population (WHO,2014).",0
The impact of UCP1 deletion on insulin sensitivity in these mice was not reported.,0
"Although the pathogenesis of obesity is extremely complex and is far from being unraveled, the key component of the obesity epidemic is long-term dysregulation of energy balance, comprising increased energy intake and/or reduced energy expenditure.",0
"Despite active research and impressive improvements in the understanding of the regulation of energy balance, there are only a very limited number of drugs that can be used for the efficient treatment of obesity and its comorbidities.",0
"It can therefore be concluded that, even though the BAT depots are present in small amounts, the activated tissue has the potential to substantially contribute to energy expenditure (Nedergaard et al.,2007).",0
"Thus, the continuous cycling of triglyceride hydrolysis coupled to resynthesis, which requires large amounts of ATP, could be another important mechanism to increase thermogenesis in BAT, in addition to the role of UCP1 activation in this process (Mottillo et al.,2014).",0
"Targeting specific components of the neuroendocrine regulation of energy intake, such as leptin or hypothalamic neuropeptides, has disappointingly revealed unsuccessful as yet.",0
New alternatives focusing on adipose tissue function could potentially be of therapeutic relevance in the future.,0
"The notion that human BAT is solely apparent during the neonatal stage prevailed for decades (Heaton,1972; Nedergaard et al.,2007).",0
"Estimates of BAT mass and activity from FDG-PET studies suggest that humans have, on average, 50â€“80 g of BAT (Peirce et al.,2014).",0
"Quantitatively, it was estimated that 50 g of BAT can burn as much as 20% of daily energy intake (Rothwell and Stock,1983).",0
"As an example, in a subject with 63 g of supraclavicular BAT, it was calculated that if the depot was fully activated, it would burn an amount of energy equivalent to 4.1 kg of WAT (Virtanen et al.,2009).",0
"Along this line, it was recently demonstrated that chronic activation of the Î²3 adrenoreceptor induces coupled increases in lipolysis, de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid beta-oxidation not only in white, but also in BAT (Mottillo et al.,2014).",0
"Similarly to what was proposed for skeletal muscle (Dulloo et al.,2004), this may contribute to dissipate excess lipids as occurs during prolonged stimulation of lipolysis (e.g., chronic Î²3 adrenoreceptor treatment).",0
Should Men Take Prenatal Vitamins?,0
"Potentially the most significant nutritional intervention has been the prenatal supplementation of folate, which has been shown to reduce the incidence of neural tube defects [3], limb malformations, urogenital abnormalities, cardiovascular malformations [4], and cleft lip or palate [5].",0
The influence of paternal diet on congenital abnormalities and fertility is still being elucidated.,0
A recent mouse study by Lambrot et al.,0
furthered our understanding of the effects of paternal folate deficiency [6].,0
Folate deficiency was associated with an increase in DNA damage in spermatocytes.,0
"However, there was no difference in sperm tail DNA fragmentation, tail length, or motility (p>0.05).",0
"Another study investigating the effect of a paternal folate-deficient diet in mice found a relationship with decreased placental weight, placental folate and an increased expression of the folate transporter folate receptor [7].",0
"A link has been found between paternal dioxin exposure, a component of the herbicide Agent Orange used in the Vietnam War, and spermatazoidfolate deficiency resulting in an increased rate of spina bifida [8].",0
"Although the precise mechanism is unclear, it is thought that epigenetic modifications (study of heritable changes in gene activity that are not caused by changes in the DNA sequence) play a role in both neural tube defects and decreased fertility of men with a folate deficiency [8].",0
"However, a prospective study of 42 couples, who had paternal methotrxate exposure at the time of conception, did not identify any congenital abnormalities [9].",0
The role of paternal nutrition on epigenetically linked heritable diseases such as cardiovascular and obesity have been suggested in epidemiological studies [10].,0
Human studies examining the role of paternal micronutrient supplementation are scant.,0
"In 2008, Young et al.",0
"investigated the role of supplemental folate, zinc and antioxidants (vitamins C, E, and Î²-carotene) on spermatocyte aneuploidy.",0
It is clear that a deficiency of paternal micronutrients could affect the development of offspring through epigenetic regulation.,0
Short Communication\nCongenital abnormalities are the leading cause of infant mortalities in the United States (25%) and across the world [1].,0
"However, it is unclear at this time whether or not supplementation of vitamins such as folate can reduce congenital anomalies in men with an otherwise well-balanced diet.",0
A prospective randomized control trial is necessary to adequately determine the role for male prenatal vitamins.,0
"Due to the lack of conclusive evidence, we cannot recommend the ubiquitous use of prenatal vitamins, in particular folate, in men attempting to plan a pregnancy with their female partner at this time.",0
Fish Intake during Pregnancy and Foetal Neurodevelopmentâ€”A Systematic Review of the Evidence\n\nAbstract\nFish is a source of several nutrients that are important for healthy foetal development.,0
"The potential for contamination by heavy metals, as well as risk of listeriosis requires careful consideration of the shaping of dietary messages related to fish intake during pregnancy.",0
"Trained examiners conducted Neurodevelopmental testing of child was completed via a Neonatal Behavioural Assessment 3 days post birth (28 behavioural & 18 reflex items).Comparator and ComparisonFish intake in quintilesWeekly servingsCategories: no fish (0 g), 1â€“2 servings (1â€“340 g per week), or 3 or more servings per week (over 340 g).Fish consumption:No fish serves, less than or equal to 2 servings per week, greater than 2 servings per week.Maternal fish intake of more than 2â€“3 times per week compared to up to once per week.No mention of intake in grams.Maternal seafood intake in grams (average intake = 300â€“360 g per week).OutcomeHighest 3 quintiles of fish intake resulted in improved motor, social/cognitive and total development scores at 18 months:OR (95%CI) = 1.28 (1.20, 1.38) for highest versus lowest quintile.This association was less obvious at 6 months (only the highest quintile showed significant improvement).Offspring of women who ate fish more than twice a week scored significantly higher on WRAVMA drawing and total scores compared with no serves.OR (95%CI) for WRAVMA drawing = 6.0 (1.8, 10.2) for more than two serves per week compared with no serves.WRAVMA total score = 5.3 (0.9, 9.6) for more than two serves per week compared to no serves.Pregnant women fish consumption greater than 2â€“3 times per week had children with significantly higher cognition and motor development scores compared to women consuming fish less than once a week.",0
This association was only significant in children breastfed for up to 6 months.Greater than 3 serves per week was not associated with improved outcomes.Seafood intake weakly ( p = 0.1) correlated with motor development.,0
"Other measures of neurodevelopment not significant in either direction.QualityNeutralPositivePositiveNeutral\nStudies were heterogeneous in methodology in regard to the covariates, neurological assessment tools, length of follow up statistical analyses.",0
"In addition, the type and amounts of fish consumed differed across study locations.",0
Due to this heterogeneity a qualitative rather than quantitative approach was deemed appropriate for comparison and presentation of findings.,0
A study by Oken et al.,0
tested children at six months of age using Visual Recognition Memory (VRM) paradigm and found a significant improvement of 2.8 points for each additional serving of fish (85â€“140 g) consumed by the mother during pregnancy [19].,0
Mendez et al .,0
"This review critically evaluates literature on fish intake in pregnant women, with a focus on the association between neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring and maternal fish intake during pregnancy.",0
found that the length of breastfeeding influenced whether a significant difference was found in offspring neurodevelopment when comparing high and low fish intakes during pregnancy [24].,0
Authors reported that fish consumption two to three times per week during pregnancy was beneficial for children who were breastfed for less than six months.,0
"However, no statistical improvement was indicated for those children who were breastfed for longer than six months [24].",0
Gale et al.,0
demonstrated no adverse effects on offspring neurodevelopment with maternal fish consumption during pregnancy equal to or greater than once per week.,0
This study reported an improved verbal Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in offspring aged nine years in children born to mothers who consumed up to two servings of fish per week compared with children born to mothers who had not consumed any fish during late pregnancy (32 weeks gestation).,0
This association was not significant for fish consumption in early pregnancy (15 weeks gestation) suggesting that fish consumption may be of more benefit during the third trimester [21].,0
A report from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) found that fish consumption during pregnancy of one to three servings per week was shown to provide a modest but significant improvement in developmental scores of the offspring for language and social activity at fifteen to eighteen months of age [18].,0
A longer follow up of the ALSPAC cohort demonstrated a reduction in the percentage of children with suboptimal IQ at eight years of age amongst mothers with a high seafood intake (greater than 340 g) during pregnancy [20].,0
A smaller ( n = 498) Japanese study did not demonstrate a positive or negative association between maternal fish intake during pregnancy and neurodevelopment as measured by the Neonatal Behavioural Assessment tool in infants at three days of age [25].,0
"Conversely, results from a US cohort study demonstrated a significant improvement in IQ with consumption of more than two maternal servings of fish intake per week as assessed via â€˜milestoneâ€™ achievement in children aged six months and eighteen months [23].",0
"Guidelines from Australia [2], Europe [3] and the USA [4] encourage the consumption of fish during pregnancy.",0
"Recent studies indicate that pregnant women lack sufficient knowledge regarding the importance of iodine and LC n -3 PUFAs [5,6], nutrients that are present in fish and seafood.",0
The aim of this review was to critically appraise literature investigating fish intake in pregnant women to assess the hypothesis that fish consumption during pregnancy positively influences foetal neurodevelopment.,0
No studies adjusted for maternal responsiveness which has been shown to be related to developmental outcomes independent of sociodemographic factors [28].,0
An intake of fish may reflect a health conscious diet and thus the positive effects may not be directly attributed to the fish but rather to the diet as a whole.,0
"Results from a large Danish national birth cohort ( n = 25,446) indicated a significant improvement in motor, cognitive and total developmental scores for eighteen month old children who were born to women within the highest three quintiles of fish intake during pregnancy.",0
"Due to heterogeneity in methodology and measured outcomes, a qualitative comparison of study findings was conducted.",0
"At six months, this improvement was only significant for children of women in the highest quintile of fish consumption, suggesting that age of testing may be relevant [22].",0
Seven of the eight reviewed articles showed a beneficial impact on certain measures of offspring neurodevelopment with fish intake ranging from less than one to three or more servings of fish per week.,0
"Thus, the evidence in these cohort studies supports the current recommendations for fish consumption during pregnancy [2,3,4].",0
"The level of this evidence is Grade C as per the ratings outlined inTable 3, adapted from Williams et al.",0
[15] indicating that the body of evidence is supportive of fish intake during pregnancy.nutrients-07-02001-t003_Table 3\n\nCaption (TABLE-WRAP): TABLE 3\n\nEvidence Rating Table [13].ComponentRatingCommentsEvidence BaseSatisfactoryNHMRC Level III (cohort studies) with moderate risk of bias [20].ConsistencyGoodSeven out of eight studies demonstrated a positive association between fish intake and foetal neurodevelopment.Clinical impactSatisfactoryTrend towards improved neurodevelopment with significant results in several domains.GeneralisabilityGoodAll studies in pregnant women.ApplicabilityPoorA variety of populations studied from different countries where type of fish and the level of contaminants would likely vary.,0
This review indicates that the benefits of diets providing moderate amounts of fish during pregnancy outweigh potential detrimental effects in regards to offspring neurodevelopment.,0
Discussion\nThis systematic review of observational cohort studies demonstrates an association between consumption of one or more servings of fish per week during pregnancy and better offspring neurodevelopment outcomes.,0
Suzuki et al.,0
[21] was the only study to report a neutral effect of seafood intake on all neurodevelopmental outcomes.,0
"However, in that study neurodevelopment was assessed when the infant was only three days old.",0
"The seven studies, which demonstrated a benefit in neurodevelopment, had a follow up time ranging from six months to nine years.",0
Thus it is possible that longer follow up may be needed to determine significant associations.,0
This concept is supported by Oken et al.,0
which found an improvement in neurodevelopmental scores at six months in only the highest quintile of fish intake while this improvement was evident in the highest three quintiles at eighteen months [22].,0
Mendez et al.,0
"[24] found that seafood consumption that excluded fish intake had a detrimental effect on neurodevelopment, while fish intake alone led to improved outcomes.",0
Thus it is possible that the study of Suzuki et al.,0
[25] may have detected a benefit had fish been considered separately from total seafood.,0
[21] reported differences in outcomes associated with oily fish intake and total fish intake in early compared to late pregnancy.,0
This suggests that the type of fish and timing of consumption during pregnancy may impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes of offspring.,0
"However, this information is limited to a single study, which was conducted in a relatively small sample ( n = 217).",0
More research in this area is required to draw sound conclusions.,0
It is important to note the number methodological limitations in research on diet and infant neurodevelopment that are present in these studies.,0
"This prevents the conclusion of a definitive relationship without further research, preferably clinical randomised controlled trials, and a proper meta-analysis.",0
Measuring dietary intake in cohort studies is problematic due to the difficulty in obtaining detailed information without causing significant subject burden.,0
"No studies reported adjusting results from the FFQ for energy intake, a recommendation made by Freedman et al .",0
"Three studies [19,21,24] reported on the frequency of consumption without specifying the weight of fish servings while the remaining studies made assumptions based on standard serving sizes, as to the quantity of fish consumed at each occasion.",0
It is important that the type of fish consumed is low in mercury.,0
This limits the accuracy of a quantifiable conclusion as due to individual variability in the perception of a â€˜serving sizeâ€™.,0
Assessing cognitive development differences in infancy and childhood is fraught with difficulties due to the nature of childhood development and the accurate measurement of such.,0
"Firstly, children develop in â€˜spurtsâ€™ rather than in a continuous fashion, which means they may slip in and out of the â€˜normalâ€™ reference ranges, particularly in the earlier years [27,28].",0
"To combat this, it has been suggested that testing occurs at more than one time point [27] and that testing should extend beyond the first two years, preferable to school aged children in order to detect more subtle differences [28].",0
"Only 4 studies tested at multiple time points [18,21,22,24], four beyond two years [20,21,23,24], and only two looked at children of school age [20,21].",0
"Secondly, there are multiple interrelated factors which impact on neurodevelopment, and not all confounders were accounted for in all analyses.",0
"Introduction\nFish is a source of several nutrients that are important during pregnancy for healthy foetal development including iodine, long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n- 3PUFAs), and vitamins A, D and B12 [1].",0
"However, factors including ethnicity, paternal intelligence, the home environment, drug use, dietary patterns, supplement use and maternal responsiveness were not always measured.",0
The ALSPAC study reports by Daniels et al.,0
"[20] included the home environment as a confounder, but not paternal IQ.",0
"Conversely, the two studies by Oken et al.",0
The remaining four studies did not correct for either paternal IQ or home environment.,0
Oken et al.,0
considered maternal diet by classifying women as following a â€œprudentâ€ or â€œwesternâ€ dietary pattern [23].,0
Hibbeln et al.,0
"[20] also adjusted for maternal diet, while Mendez et al.",0
Other studies did not effectively account for dietary intake and are thus at risk of bias.,0
"Guidelines from Australia, Europe and the USA encourage fish consumption during pregnancy.",0
"[20] reported that only 1.7% of women consumed fish oil supplements not affecting outcomes, however, this study did not consider supplements other than fish oil.",0
Only Mendez et al.,0
[24] included supplement usage as a confounder.,0
There is no universal standard for which neurodevelopmental tests are most appropriate for use in children of varying ages and at what age meaningful differences in neurocognitive development can be detected [29].,0
"Performance in assessments can be significantly altered if the participant is hungry, tired or fearful of being in a strange place or being tested [27].",0
The accuracy of the tests for the population depends on when the test was standardised and within what population.,0
"In particular the Denver test, utilised in the ALSPAC study [18] has been criticised for its low specificity and potentially outdated â€˜normâ€™ as it was standardised in 1980 [30].",0
"Research on the reliability of parental reports on child development is conflicting [31], Daniels et al.",0
"[22] used developmental testing carried out by the mother and thus results may not be as reliable as those reported by other studies, which used trained professionals.",0
"Due to the risks associated with consuming fish and seafood during pregnancy related to food safety and heavy metal contamination, pregnant women may question the necessity of including these foods in their diets, when nutrition supplements are readily accessible in Western countries [32].",0
A systematic review of randomised control trials examining LC n -3PUFA supplementation during pregnancy found no clear association between supplement use and infant cognitive outcomes [33].,0
"This may be attributable to the synergistic effects of food [34] and associated with fish being a source of other nutrients which are important for infant development such as iodine and vitamin D. Presently, there have been no randomised control trials examining neurocognitive outcomes associated with prenatal multivitamin use and infant neurodevelopment, and these are unlikely to occur given ethical implications of such [35].",0
"In addition, it appears Australian women are falling short of LC n- 3PUFA intake recommendations during pregnancy [6,7].",0
Recent research has suggested that effects of methyl-mercury on infant brain development may be mediated by LC n -3PUFA [36].,0
"Because it is possible to consume fish and seafood safely during pregnancy, through following recommendations to limit high mercury species, it is prudent to recommend that pregnant women consume these foods, rather than rely on supplementation, in order to maximise infant neurodevelopment outcomes.",0
Conclusions\nThis review assessed the hypothesis that fish intake during pregnancy improves offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes.,0
"A review of the available evidence indicates that intake of fish during pregnancy is associated with positive foetal neurodevelopmental outcomes, as supported by seven of eight articles reviewed, which showed a beneficial impact on foetal neurodevelopment with one or more servings of fish per week compared with no fish intake.",0
Based on the results from these observational studies the current recommendation of two to three servings per week appears appropriate.,0
"Randomised clinical trials have been conducted using fish oil supplementation in pregnancy, but not with fish considered as a whole food.",0
Existing evidence is currently insufficient to inform advice regarding fish intake during pregnancy.,0
"Further well designed studies are required to strengthen the evidence base regarding the type and quantity of maternal fish consumption during pregnancy and associated neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring, while considering the contribution of mercury from fish-containing diets.",0
"On average, Australian women are consuming 33 g of fish per day and pregnant women an average of 28 g of fish per day, below Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) recommended intakes [8].",0
"As well as being a source of essential nutrients, fish are also a potential source of contaminants including mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins [9].",0
"Guidelines emphasising the health risks of methyl-mercury, with little mention of important nutrients found in fish, may be contributing to women consuming less than the recommended fish servings during pregnancy [10].",0
Thus the risks and benefits resulting from fish consumption need to be considered and scientific evidence should direct advice given to pregnant women to help them make the safest choice.,0
"There are many documented health benefits from fish consumption with regard to foetal health, including improved neurodevelopment, increased birth weight and a reduced risk of spontaneous abortion [11,12].",0
"This review focuses on neurodevelopmental outcomes for the foetus as much of the published research into fish consumption during pregnancy has focused on methyl-mercury, LC n -3PUFAs and iodine, all known to impact foetal neurodevelopment [13,14].",0
This review concludes with a discussion highlighting some of the methodological issues in researching associations between diet and infant neurodevelopment.,0
The search strategy did not yield any randomised controlled trials of fish intake in pregnant women and associated foetal neurodevelopmental outcomes.,0
"When mercury confounder was adjusted for, this association became significant: 4.0 (1.3 to 6.7).Mothers consuming greater than 2 fish serves per week had infants with the greatest VRM scores.Seafood intake during pregnancy was associated with a significant reduction in percentage of children with suboptimal IQ and behaviour test scores in 9 of 23 outcomes.Non-seafood consumers during pregnancy had children who scored lower on tests of verbal IQ at 8 years: OR (CI) for no seafood = 1.48 (1.16â€“1.90); some seafood 1.09 (0.92â€“1.20) compared with >340 g per week [overall trend: p = 0.004].Oily fish consumption more than once per week versus no oily fish reduced the risk of hyperactivity.No association with fish consumption in early pregnancy and full scale IQ, however, total fish intake in late pregnancy of 1 to 2 serves per week was associated with having a child with higher IQ at age 9 years.Higher intakes (3 or more serves per week) did not show a statistically significant improvement.Regression coefficients (95% CI) for fish consumption and full scale IQ: less than once per week vs. no fish = 7.76 (0.38 to 15.1), once or twice per week vs. no fish = 6.91 (0.19 to 13.6).Verbal IQ & fish consumption: Increase of 7.32 (0.26 to 14.4) with fish consumption once or twice per week.",0
Recent nationwide shortages of low-calcium formula (LCF) suggest this problem may be widespread.,0
"To determine if IIH is occurring more commonly, de-identified, first-measured serum calcium from all infants <6 months (n=5796) measured in our laboratory, were grouped by years 2005-2007 (n=1516), 2008-2010 (n=1945) and 2011-2013 (n=2335).",0
The biochemistry of our patients with IIH raises variations in Vitamin D metabolism or calcium set-point as potential associated factors.,0
"In 7/10 infants with data available, treated with LCF for median 95 days (range 25-310), median PTH rose to 17.1pmol/L ([8.2-49.3], P=0.02) with a trend to lower 25OHVit D (median 23nmol/L [<10-108], P=0.09) despite continued high-normal calcium levels (median 2.66mmol/L [2.11-2.75]).",0
Concurrent changes in rates of hyper and hypo-calcaemia suggest antenatal vitamin D3supplementation as an aetiological factor.,0
"IIH was associated with significant morbidity, including symptomatic hypercalcaemia and nephrocalcinosis.",0
"Treatment with LCF prevented further symptomatic hypercalcaemia, but resulted in elevated PTH.",0
CYP24A1 mutations have been identified as a potential cause of IIH.,0
"In other words, ICDS reflects the countryâ€™s obligation to enhance the pre-school education rates and an effective strategy to break the vicious cycle of malnutrition, infection and mortality (3).",0
"Different indicator such as the number of beneficiaries enrolled in Anganwadicentre for supplementary nutrition or for preschool education has been proposed to monitor the implementation of the scheme in different Anganwadi centres of the country (1,5).",0
The rationale to deliver a bunch of services is to mutually enhance the impact of a specific service with the aid of other services in the long-run (2).,0
"As far as the vacancy status is concerned, almost 33.9%, 35%, 7.1%, and 7.2% of CDPOs, Supervisors, Anganwadi workers and Anganwadi helpers posts are still vacant in the country.",0
"In the mission to enhance and compound the benefit of services delivered under ICDS, Government of India has developed partnerships with the international agencies like United Nations International Childrenâ€™ Emergency Fund (for providing technical guidance in developing need-based training plans; assist in organizing scientific workshops; and in impact assessment on early childhood nutrition and development), Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (contribution in the areas of maternal and child health, girl primary education, etc.",0
"To conclude, the ICDS scheme is a comprehensive approach for delivering an integrated package of services to bring about a significant improvement in the child related health, care, and nutrition practices of the community.",0
Findings of a study revealed the positive impact on reducing the levels of anemia in children between 6-60 months in India (6).,0
"In another study conducted in rural pocket of Varanasi to evaluate the impact of ICDS on maternal nutrition and birth weight, it was concluded that undernourished antenatal women are definitely benefitted by late pregnancy nutrition supplement (7).",0
"As a part of the capacity building efforts, the Ministry of Women & Child Development has recommended policy related and institutional transformations.",0
"The strategy is to develop Anganwadi as a â€œvibrant early childhood development centreâ€ by giving greater focus on under three years children, strengthening early childhood education, and by ensuring care and counseling of mothers and family.",0
"In addition, the Ministry is planning to improve the supplementary nutrition services; creating Anganwadi based crÃ¨ches centers; intensify monitoring, and training activities; to develop linkages with different stakeholders such as Pan-chayati Raj Institutions and ministry of rural development (1).",0
"[""Perceptions of antenatal care services by pregnant women attending government health centres in the Buea Health District, Cameroon: a cross sectional study\n\nAbstract\n\nIntroduction\nUser'sperception of quality of ANC services crucially impacts continuity of use of these services and hence pregnancy outcome.""]",0
"However, there were elements of dissatisfaction with health centre services, poor sitting facilities, amenities, few health education talks and poor nursing skills.",0
"Here, the perception of the past users is the only driving tool to refer.",0
The husband has been shown to play a significant role in determining the choice of ANC site by the woman in a Nigerian [19] and Ugandan study [20] where they accounted for 43% and 32% of all recommendations respectively.,0
"Evaluation of the reasons why 55.2% of respondents changed their ANC site, revealed that the change of residence, closeness to the health facility and the quality of care offered at the previous site were the predominant reasons.",0
"This observation is similar to studies carried out in Kenya [13] and South Africa [14] where women started clinic late because of perceived lack of benefit, limited facility access, uncertainty about pregnancy and â€œlazinessâ€ to go for many visits.",0
This observation is similar to that seen in Uganda [17] and Zimbabwe [18] where it was also shown that the quality of care provided was contributory.,0
"Hence efforts should be geared towards improving on health centre variables (cleanliness, comfort in sitting area and quality of care amongst others) to improve on their utilization by the women who live nearby especially for those health centres which are relatively new and by so doing increasing their attendance rate.",0
"However, attitudes are changing towards the â€œminimum of 4 visitsâ€ recommended by the WHO after the work of Nigenda et al [21] and Langer et al.",0
This accounts for the low rate of these health talks in this study as opposed to other studies [26].,0
Hence there is a need to mobilize efforts for a better quality assessment in our health care provision with the aim of improving quality in terms of provision of health care services.,0
"[""This further emphasizes the importance of distance as a dominant factor in determining women's choice of site [19].""]",0
"[""Pregnant women's knowledge about the timing, goals of ANC visits, and the number of antenatal visits was very high among the study participants contrary to what was shown in studies carried out in Tanzania [14] and South Africa [15].""]",0
"Concerning the number of ANC visits, the health centres follow the Western model of clinic visits with an average of 10 to 12 visits.",0
High educational level (high school and university) (X2= 8.714; p = 0.01) and first time pregnancy(X2= 4.217; p= 0.04) were significantly associated with poor satisfaction.,0
"If this approach is vulgarized, it might increase the uptake of ANC services and improve on the quality of health care.",0
The health care education topics were similar among the studies reviewed though there were some disparities in the frequency.,0
"[""45.2% of respondents received information on the detection or management of pregnancy danger signs, an observation similar to the 42% in Pembe's study in Tanzania [23].""]",0
"In marked contrast, the Kenyan study by Ouma and collaborators [24] and that in Nigeria by Dairo and Owoyokun [25] found that only 10.4% and up to 89.6% of pregnant women were informed of pregnancy danger signs respectively.",0
"Conclusion\nPolicy makers should implement changes in the health care delivery system taking into account the usersâ€™ preferences, more so in the light of increasing female education in Cameroon.",0
Respondents rated the services provided at the health centres generally as satisfactory.,0
"The services offered were acceptable in contrast with observations from other studies in Sub-Saharan countries such as in Uganda by Cham et al [27] and that by van Eijket al [4] in Kenya where for example, urine and serological tests are not routinely done.",0
"With regards to waiting time at the clinic, the women recognized that most of the time wasting was due to late coming of their fellow pregnant women.",0
"However, dissatisfaction abounded with respect to this aspect, especially for women of higher educational levels.",0
The women with high level of education and women attending for their first pregnancies were not satisfied with the competence of the staff.,0
Most of them recommended an improvement in the nursesâ€™ skills.,0
"Introduction\nThe fifth Millennium Development Goal (MDG), â€œImprovement of Maternal Healthâ€ [1] has Antenatal Care (ANC) coverage or attendance as a progress indicator.",0
"However, women attending for their subsequent pregnancies and those at their third or more visits were more tolerant of the services provided at the health centres.",0
This is probably because their contact with the health system had tailored their expectations and they expressed satisfaction with the existing services.,0
"Women attending ANC for their subsequent pregnancies probably had a notion of what health topics were discussed during clinic sessions and so their objectives at ANC were not only aimed at acquiring knowledge about diet, danger signs and other topics but also in the state of their babies.",0
Primigravida on the contrary expected vital information from the health talks to help them cope well with their pregnancy and labor [29].,0
"However, an Australian study showed that both women and providers thought the time for antenatal classes was too small to incorporate all they had to learn with some women complaining of having received too much information [29].",0
"However, in Cameroon, MMR has risen by 8 %from 680 to 872 deaths per 100 000 in the past 9 years after the initial decrease [3].",0
"These results are similar to other studies of patient satisfaction; (96.5%) in Ibadan, Nigeria [7] and 86.4% in Ogun State, Nigeria [25].",0
"However, it has been said that the views of pregnant women concerning their care is generally positive as they tend to be uncritical of healthcare, accepting whatever care they receive as appropriate [29].",0
"[""Thus using patient views to evaluate health care has been criticized [30], regarding their responses as a mixture of the healthcare performance measurement and the respondent's reflection.""]",0
"Nevertheless, patient views provide an insight to the care provided and the system as a whole.",0
The influence of the educational level of respondents is predominant here as it is noticed that those at a high educational level are more likely to be critical about care received and defer a positive satisfaction.,0
"This issue was also revealed in Fawole and colleaguesâ€™ study [7] where they hypothesized that as the level of education in the community steadily increases, pregnant women may become more and more critical of health care.",0
"Studies on ANC in low income countries have mainly focused on monitoring quantifiable data such as the number of antennal visits during ANC [3,4] and its effects on pregnancy outcome [5].",0
Improvement must be made to attain a desired change and amelioration in our health care delivery package.,0
"The usersâ€™ opinion has been sought here and it is noticed that they recommend ameliorations in the interpersonal interaction with staff in terms of more comprehensive health talks and improvement in nursing skills, better infrastructures(like good toilet facilities and comfortable sitting areas) and tolerable waiting times.",0
A step in this direction will go a long way to consolidate the improvement in health care delivery sought by Cameroon in the framework of the MDGs.,0
Conclusion\nAbout one third of pregnant women in our study population attended an ANC site different from their local catchment area despite the availability of ANC in their residential area.,0
"[""High educational level and primiparity are negatively associated with pregnant women's satisfaction of care received at ANC.""]",0
"Taken together, policy makers should implement changes in the health care delivery system taking into account the usersâ€™ opinion, more so in the light of increasing female education in Cameroon.",0
"However, the perspective is changing from one of not just needing any service to one in which quality is a key component in health care provision [6,7].",0
"In Cameroon, there are few reported studies on the quality of ANC services rendered; meanwhile the study of consumer perceptions in relation to behavioral outcomes has been on the rise in other countries [8].",0
"[""This study is therefore designed to investigate pregnant women's perception of quality of ANC services rendered in health facilities within the Buea Health District area.""]",0

Discussion\nThe study aimed at exploring the perceptions of pregnant women attending antenatal clinic in the public health centres in the Buea Health District regarding antenatal care in terms of their knowledge and satisfaction with service delivery.,0

Only 6% of women started visits in the first trimester while 14.5% began in the third trimester.,0
Late antenatal visits attendance is detrimental because it prevents the clients from obtaining the maximum benefits from the antenatal service [14â€“16].,0
"With respect to the reasons that influenced the respondentsâ€™ choice of health centre, the main factor affecting the choice of ANC site was geographical accessibility.",0
This illustrates the importance of previous contact with a facility to determine further use.,0
"Pre-pregnancy body mass index, weight gain and energy intake in pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus\n\nBackground\nStudies have shown that maternal obesity is associated with increased risk of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM).",0
"Nutritional intervention is important for the control of GDM, as it provides benefits to mother and fetal health.",0
"However, the literature remains inconclusive on the role of dietary factors in the development of this disease.",0
Further studies are needed to better elucidate the role of dietary factors and specific nutrients in the risk for this disease.,0
"Objective\nTo evaluate and relate pre-pregnancy body mass index (PPBMI), weight gain and energy intake at diagnosis of GDM.",0
"Conclusion\nThe importance of nutritional counseling before conception and during pregnancy should be emphasized in order to encourage proper PPBMI and avoidance of excessive gestational weight gain, since both are related to risk for GDM.",0
Excessive gestational weight gain is also associated with risk of GDM.,0
"Moreover, dietary factors, before and during pregnancy, have been linked to increased risk for GDM.",0
In addition to the most common factors the sedentary lifestyle may also be a risk factor for GDM.,0
An adequate pre-pregnancy nutritional status was associated with gestational weight gain above recommendations.,0
These Results emphasize the need for pregnant women to be professionally monitored so that modifiable risk factors can be managed.,0
"In this sample there was a high prevalence of: unfavorable pre-pregnancy nutritional status (overweight or obesity), gestational weight gain above recommendations (PPBMI <25 kg/m2is associated with greater weight gain compared to obese), family history of diabetes, advanced age (38.2%) and low levels of physical activity (data shown in Figure1).",0

"Circulating Cathelicidin Concentrations in a Cohort of Healthy Children: Influence of Age, Body Composition, Gender and Vitamin D Status\n\nAbstract\nCathelicidin is an antimicrobial peptide whose circulating levels are related to vitamin D status in adults.",0
"This study sought to determine if circulating cathelicidin concentrations in healthy children are related to the age of the child, body composition and vitamin D status at birth and at the time of the study visit.",0
"Despite differences in vitamin D status, there were no significant associations between cathelicidin, race/ethnicity and vitamin D status (see Table 2 ).",0
"In addition, there were no significant correlations found between concentration of cathelicidin and the childâ€™s 25(OH)D concentration at birth, maternal 25(OH)D within one month of delivery, or maternal 25(OH)D area under the curve from pregnancy visits 3â€“7.",0
"Within the entire cohort, age of the child and cathelicidin concentration demonstrated a positive correlation (Ï = 0.236, p = 0.005).",0
"When the data were stratified by gender in post-hoc analyses, only the male population continued to demonstrate this correlation (Ï = 0.292, p = 0.014), while females did not (Ï = 0.103, p = 0.425).",0
"The cohortâ€™s median cathelicidin concentration was 28.1 ng/mL (range: 5.6â€“3368.6) and did not correlate with 25(OH)D, but was positively correlated with advancing age (Ï = 0.236 & p = 0.005, respectively).",0
"Although not statistically significant, a slightly negative trend of increased cathelicidin correlated with a decreased frequency of diagnosed infections within the last year (Ï = -0.147, p = 0.092).10.1371/journal.pone.0152711.g001\n\nCaption (FIG): FIG 1\nCathelicidin Concentration by Age.",0

"A positive correlation between age and cathelicidin and between gender and cathelicidin were noted, with higher concentrations in male children.",0
"Regardless of vitamin D status, there was no statistically significant difference in cathelicidin concentrations between subjects, consistent with the findings of other recent studies [6,7,12,14,17,20].",0
"This study demonstrated that as children age, the concentration of cathelicidin increases.",0
"Varying observations, however, have been made when determining whether a correlation between 25(OH)D and cathelicidin concentrations exists.",0
"In the literature, recent studies across a wide range of populations have demonstrated a positive correlation between 25(OH)D and cathelicidin [8â€“11,15,16,18,19].",0
"Differences in age, health and initial vitamin D status between cohorts, as well as study design, may explain the conflicting data.",0
"Of note, most of the children in this study were not vitamin D deficient and the vitamin D ranges were relatively narrow.",0
"Additionally, the lack of correlation may suggest that circulating cathelicidin concentration is not reflective of what is happening at the cellular level, and in this regard, cathelicidin mRNA expression by immune cells or target tissue may be a better indicator of vitamin Dâ€™s long-term effect on the cathelicidin system.",0
"Furthermore, male gender was significantly associated with increased cathelicidin concentrations.",0
Adipose tissue is also believed to be associated with vitamin D [26â€“29].,0
"This result is consistent with the findings of Jeng et al., who also showed no correlation with BMI and cathelicidin in adults with sepsis [9].",0
"Although not significant, a negative trend was seen between the number of infections a child experienced and cathelicidin concentration.",0
"This suggests that cathelicidin may have a protective benefit in preventing disease, which is consistent with its antimicrobial properties.",0
The lack of association between vitamin D status and cathelicidin in this study may be due to the narrow range in observed 25(OH)D values and warrants additional studies for further observation.,0
This is an exciting area of study; especially as antibiotic resistance becomes an increasing problem.,0
"Investigating ways to improve natural immune function and limit the number of infections people experience is of great importanceâ€¦\nIn this study, a positive correlation between age and cathelicidin was shown.",0
It assists in identifying the normal ranges of circulating cathelicidin concentrations found in healthy children.,0
This positive correlation between cathelicidin and age was also shown in the oral environment when examining cathelicidin concentrations in saliva in healthy children aged 2 to 18 years [30].,0
"Importantly, as Alvarezâ€“Rodriguez and colleagues have found a negative correlation between age and immune function in healthy adult subjects, especially those over the age of 60 [15], perhaps innate immune function, in particular cytokine function, increases with age for a period of time, reaches a threshold and then decreases later in life.",0
"Interestingly, our findings that male gender correlates with cathelicidin peeks further interest in understanding gender differences in regards to the immune system.",0
"Notably, in the aforementioned study examining localized cathelicidin concentrations in saliva, the female gender was found to positively correlate with cathelicidin [30].",0
These findings highlight the differences one may find when examining localized and circulating levels of immune factors.,0
Limitations of this study include the cohort size and an unequal distribution of subjects within age groups.,0
"As such, this study should be repeated with a larger sample size to replicate its findings.",0
Inclusion of older children and young adults would allow cathelicidin to be followed throughout a longer period of childhood development and further describe how cathelicidin and innate immune function develop over time.,0
"Lastly, total circulating cathelicidin was measured rather than cell-specific mRNA expression of cathelicidin or 1,25(OH)2D3concentration [17], which may be more closely linked with vitamin D status during fetal and childhood development.",0
"In conclusion, this study is the first to examine cathelicidin concentrations in healthy children over time.",0
"It also supports the premise that cathelicidin increases with increasing age, particularly in males.",0
"With further study, cathelicidin may serve as a biomarker of enhanced immune function over time in children with age-based norms.",0
"Previous studies have focused on cathelicidin and vitamin D concentrations in patient populations affected by various illnesses or diseases [6], such as tuberculosis [7], pneumonia [8], sepsis [9], HIV [10â€“12], and end-stage renal disease hemodialysis [13], as well as healthy adult populations [14â€“19].",0
"Additionally, while one study examined the levels of maternal and neonatal vitamin D and cathelicidin concentrations in healthy children at delivery, there is a lack of research to determine correlations between vitamin D status and cathelicidin among healthy children over time [20], as well as which factors such as age of the child, gender, and body composition may independently impact cathelicidin concentrations.",0
"To address this gap in the literature, the aim of this follow-up study was to determine if maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy and/or a childâ€™s current vitamin D status affect the circulating concentration of cathelicidin in healthy children years after delivery.",0
A second aim was to determine if the concentration of cathelicidin and vitamin D correlate with the number of infections a child experiences during childhood and as a function of age.,0
It was hypothesized that (1) total current circulating 25(OH)D would be positively correlated with cathelicidin in children; (2) children with higher plasma cathelicidin concentrations would have had fewer infections than children with lower cathelicidin concentrations; and (3) cathelicidin concentration would increase with advancing age.,0
A post-hoc analysis was conducted to determine if BMI and percent fat had an effect on cathelicidin concentration.,0
"Four multivariable regressions were performed to assess whether any significant associations existed between the natural logarithm of each subjectâ€™s cathelicidin concentration and each of the following vitamin D measurements: (1) childâ€™s current 25(OH)D at time of follow-up, (2) childâ€™s 25(OH)D at birth, (3) maternal 25(OH)D throughout pregnancy (Visits 3 to 7 as area under the curve), and (4) maternal 25(OH)D one month before delivery; all analyses controlled for race/ethnicity, age, gender, and percent fat.",0
The size of this studyâ€™s cohort provided us with 80% power to detect correlations as small as 0.24.,0
"Of the children in the cohort, 20.3% were found to be vitamin D deficient, as defined by a 25(OH)D concentration <20 ng/mL.10.1371/journal.pone.0152711.t001\n\nCaption (TABLE-WRAP): TABLE 1\nChild Sociodemographics and Clinical Characteristics.CharacteristicValue\xa0n = 133Race/Ethnicity [n (%)]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Black41 (30.8)\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0White38 (28.6)\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Hispanic54 (40.6)Gender [n (%)]\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Female62 (46.6)\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Male71 (53.4)Age1(years)4.7 Â± 1.2 (2â€“7)BMI116.1 Â± 2.5 (12.1â€“28.8)% Fat125.5 Â± 6.1 (14.6â€“42.9)No.",0

Are Attributes of Pregnancy and the Delivery Room Experience Related to Development of Autism?,0
"It is a complex condition that lacks an established preventive method, warranting a need for research to identify possible environmental triggers.",0
"The assertion that autism patients engage in repetitive, behavioral patterns has arguably become stereotyped.",0
"The symptoms of autism become notable in patient in the first three years of life and may necessitate lifelong care that must be provided by family members, guardians, or healthcare professionals.",0
"[""Autism and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), including Asperger's syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder, have become increasingly diagnosed over the past decade.""]",0
"Accordingly, population studies, which have been conducted by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have reported a prevalence of ASDs of 1 of 68 children at risk.",0
"It should be noted, however, that, from a stand-alone perspective, each of the factors (as listed above) that link autism with pre-, peri-, and neonatal care does not correlate consistently as the incidence of autism is reviewed in terms of its cross-reference amongst various research studies.",0
The identification of external factors particularly perinatal risk factors forms the initial critical step in preventing and alleviating risks.,0
"It should also be noted that, despite ongoing research efforts, relatively little has yet been divulged regarding delivery-room attributes that may be directly or indirectly associated with the incidence of autism.",0
"Furthermore, the nature of the precise catalyst of autism has not been revealed as of yet.",0
We conducted a literature review to assess evidence suggested in the worldwide literature.,0
"Early diagnosis of autism and any subsequent related intervention(s) may serve to alleviate the challenges that are faced by those individuals, who must manage the effects of autism on an ongoing basis, including patients, their guardians and/or families, and related healthcare professionals.",0
The following narrative review aims to better understand the existing evidence for perinatal and labor-related associations with autism.,0
"Discussion\nThe etiology of autism is unknown, although perinatal and neonatal exposures have been the focus of recent epidemiologic research [57].",0
"Exposure to certain medications such as perinatal medications, antiepileptic drugs, supplements, and SSRIs has been studied as well as drug exposure to cocaine and smoking.",0
"Artificial insemination and fertility medications, meconium aspiration syndrome, and birth weight have also all been subjects of focus and the respective association with pregnancy and neurodevelopmental complications such as autism.",0
"Perinatal risk factors that have a suggested association include Î² 2 adrenergic receptor agonists, labor induction and augmentation, maternal infection and disease (i.e., antiphospholipid syndrome), antiepileptic drugs, cocaine use, and oral supplements.",0
Several studies have suggested the association between perinatal factors and the onset of autism.,0
"A recent case control study done in New South Wales, Australia, focused on determining risk factors for autism.",0
"Four factors were shown to be significantly associated with autism: being male, premature birth, maternal age greater than or equal to 35 years, and mothers born outside of Australia, with highest risk found in mothers from North-East or South-East Asia [7].",0
"A separate study from Western Australia concluded that autistic children generally had parents who were older and had greater frequencies of threatened abortions, epidural anesthesia, labor induction, and labor duration of less than 1 hour.",0
"These children were more often born first, had a low Apgar score, and tended to have more complications [8].",0
Similar studies using a Swedish medical birth registry observed different factors that affected autism spectrum disorders.,0
"The researchers found that prematurity, low Apgar scores, growth restriction, or macrosomia, and if the mother was from sub-Saharan Africa or East Asia had a positive correlation with autism spectrum disorders [9].",0
Smoking has not been found to have a direct association.,0
Information obtained from the Finnish prenatal study of autism and autism spectrum disorders correlated advanced paternal age with an increased risk of ASD [10].,0
A group in Norway assessed the association between interpregnancy lengths and ASD and found that interpregnancy intervals for less than 9 months and interpregnancy between 9 and 11 months carried an increased risk for ASD [11].,0
Identification of environmental factors is the first step in preventing and mitigating risks by primary prevention [1].,0
"Furthermore, while the incidence and the prevalence of autism also tend to raise on an ever-increasing basis, public health concerns over the disorder have also been coupled with concerns over its etiology, which is still in the investigative stage of clinical research [2].",0
[37] expanded on this and illustrated a case control study of 4429 children with autism.,0
"[""Overall, these birth weight studies illustrate that more research with larger populations needs to be conducted to determine whether autism etiology is genetic in relation to birth weight, whether birth weight is a risk factor or a cause of autism, how much mother's gestational age plays a role, and whether pre- or postpregnancy weight of the mother has a larger effect on prevalence of autism and ASD as research currently supports a variety of findings.""]",0
The identification of prenatal factors that are linked to autism may serve as a paradigm shift in our current view and management of autism.,0
Further evidence is suggested by other studies.,0
"The mothers of autistic children were studied, and it was demonstrated that the cases with autism had more pregnancy complications.",0
"They were more likely to have experienced fetal distress, been delivered by an elective or emergency cesarean section, and had an Apgar score of less than 6 at one minute.",0
"It was concluded that although autism is unlikely to be caused by a single obstetric factor, there was an increased prevalence of obstetric complications among autism cases that is most likely due to underlying genetic factors and an interaction of these factors with the environment [8].",0
Another Australian study evaluated maternal conditions and perinatal characteristics associated with ASD and intellectual disability.,0
"Although a weak correlation was found between poor intrauterine environments and ASD with intellectual disabilities, there was no relationship found between ASD without intellectual disabilities and perinatal factors [12].",0
ASD may involve additional pathologies at the neuroanatomical level.,0
"A recent study illustrates that the neuropathology of some individuals who are diagnosed as having ASD may actually also have focal cortical dysplasias, which could explain the high incidence of sensory irregularities and seizures in ASD diagnosed patients [59].",0
"Thus, focal cortical dysplasias may be a risk factor for ASD patients.",0
"No specific article examined specific aspects such as room temperature, lack of equipment, time spent with the mother, or proximity to other neonates.",0
"Pollutants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, artificial insemination, and fertility medications may have a link, but results are often conflicted.",0
"However, some sources did cite other factors that could potentially be associated with the delivery room itself.",0
"These include the type of birth, such as whether it was breech, a prolonged birth, or an induced birth, along with various forms of fetal measures such as birth cry, fetal distress, low heart rate, or high fetal blood pressure [2,3,13â€“15,60].",0
"Further, a possible association exists with ventilation of neonates [16].",0
"Feeding practices have also been looked at, as well as maternal states such as high temperature or an unhappy maternal emotional state [17â€“19,58].",0
"Lastly, the environmental impact of perinatal air pollutants has also been observed [20,21].",0
"Because these studies have pointed to all of these various factors which in and of themselves can all occur within a delivery room atmosphere, they warrant a further look into even more specific delivery room attributes to see if there is a more direct association between them and autism.",0
"2.1. Î² 2 Adrenergic Receptor Agonists\nBeyond the cases conducted to study the relationship between pregnancy complications and augmented childbirth to autism, several studies have been done to investigate the association between prenatal exposures to Î² 2 adrenergic receptor agonists to autism spectrum disorders.",0
"Factors related to the delivery room experience may be associated with meconium aspiration syndrome, birth weight, and labor time.",0
Terbutaline can cross the placenta and potentially affect the developing neonatal brain [22].,0
"In a study of neonatal rats, Zerrate et al.",0
"found neuroinflammatory and behavioral changes, similar to that in autism, after administering terbutaline to subjects.",0
"[""The results demonstrated that terbutaline increased microglial activation in the subjects' cerebral cortex, cerebellar, and cerebrocortical white matter [23].""]",0
"Nucleotide polymorphism of the Î² 2 adrenergic receptor gene has also been implicated as risk factors for autism, namely, Gly 16 and Glu 27 [24,25].",0
"The researchers of independent subjects and dizygotic twins found that activation of receptors with either polymorphism has been link with increased signaling, secondary to decreased downregulation of the Î² 2 adrenergic receptor gene.",0
"Critics of these genetic predisposition argued that since many genes are involved in the etiology of autism, the role of any single gene polymorphism in causing autism is small.",0
The effect of each gene is further diluted by variable penetrance [61].,0
"They showed that there was no evidence linking Î² 2 adrenergic receptor agonist exposure in pregnancy with an increase in autism risk, except exposure to terbutaline during the third trimester for more than two days [26,62].",0
The authors suggested that future studies with larger sample sizes would be helpful to endorse or challenge their findings.,0
"Based on aggregated evidence from animal and human studies, Witter et al.",0
"proposed that permanent changes in autonomic tone could result in neurological changes in the fetus, especially after two or more weeks of high dose Î² 2 adrenergic receptor agonist exposure.",0
These functional and behavioral changes may contribute to the signs and symptoms of autism [27].,0
"Maternal Disease\nIn addition to environmental factors, infection and disease may play a role in the development of autism.",0
"Children born to mothers with antiphospholipid syndrome were observed to have a higher frequency of autism spectrum disorders in comparison to mothers without antiphospholipid syndrome, which further supports findings that perinatal complications increase the risk of autism in children [28].",0
Several risk factors during the pregnancy and labor periods have been associated with autism; yet further studies with large populations are needed to establish definitive associations.,0
Another study was organized to determine ASD in children born preterm and the role of exposure to perinatal inflammation.,0
It was a review that covered the evidence supporting the idea that prenatal infection on the central nervous system may increase the incidence of autism spectrum disorders [63].,0
This increase in C-reactive protein has been found to have a correlation with a risk for autism spectrum disorders [29].,0
"Antiepileptic Drugs\nAlthough it has been shown that autism is unlikely to be caused by a single factor, there have been many studies conducted studying the relationship between the use of certain medications during pregnancy and the associated risk of autism.",0
"For example, the increased prevalence of the use of anticonvulsant medications during pregnancy is correlated with an increased risk of autism.",0
Valproate is used for the treatment of epilepsy and other neuropsychological disorders and is considered one of the only available treatment options for women of childbearing potential [6].,0
"Recent studies, however, have shown that exposure to valproate during pregnancy indicates a significantly increased risk of autism spectrum disorder, even after adjusting for maternal epilepsy.",0
Studies exposing pregnant rats and mice to valproate demonstrated increased autistic-like behaviors in the offspring.,0
The animal studies performed by Roullet have been used as a model to ameliorate and improve upon studies that focus on the association between the risk of autism and the maternal need for anticonvulsants [5].,0
The current recommendation of health care professionals is to avoid anticonvulsant drug use such as valproate during pregnancy.,0
"It is important, however, to assess the intrinsic iatrogenic risk of birth defects or perinatal complications and the general safety for the expectant mother before discontinuing anticonvulsants [31].",0
Oral Supplements\nPrenatal supplements are an important component of a healthy pregnancy.,0
Prenatal folic acid supplements have been shown to reduce the risk of neural tube defects in children and are associated with a lower risk of autistic disorder [32].,0
"This study also analyzed the use of fish oil supplements, which showed no association with autistic disorder [32].",0
"Although no causality was found, it was determined that prenatal folic acid supplements taken during pregnancy were associated with a decreased risk of autistic disorder.",0
"Vitamin D, which has a unique role in brain homeostasis, embryogenesis and neurodevelopment, neural differentiation, and gene regulation, has recently been proposed as a possible environmental risk factor for autism during early childhood.",0
"On the other hand, the involvement of maternal vitamin D during pregnancy in autism requires proper investigation.",0
"Recent studies have shown that a wide range of disorders, including neuropsychiatric disorders and autism, are associated with increased homocysteine levels in biological fluids.",0
"Therefore, it is crucial to monitor the homocysteine levels in body fluids of autistic children.",0
"It can provide information on genetic and physiological diseases, improper lifestyle (including dietary habits), and a variety of pathological conditions.",0
"Illicit Drug Exposure, Smoking, and Pollutants\nDrug exposure may have very serious complications during pregnancy.",0
A study was conducted to evaluate the association between autism and developmental abnormalities in children with perinatal cocaine exposure.,0
The fact that several risk factors during the prenatal and labor periods are implicated in autism should prompt the medical community to focus on the pregnancy and labor periods as preventive measures to curb the incidence of autism.,0
It was concluded that most of the cases had language delays and difficulties with expressive skills and communication disorders.,0
"Significant neurodevelopmental abnormalities were observed and a high frequency of autism was found in children exposed to cocaine, especially in comparison to those exposed to alcohol or opiates alone [33].",0
Smoking has been found to be an environmental hazard.,0
"[""Studies have been done determining the effects of smoking in a pregnant patient and the risk of autism in the mother's offspring.""]",0
"It was assessed that maternal smoking was related to a modest increase in the risk of Pervasive Developmental Disorders, however, there was no known association between maternal smoking and childhood autism [34].",0
"Interestingly, the amount of air pollution that a mother and child were exposed to including traffic related air pollution and nitrogen dioxide, both during pregnancy and during the first year of life, was associated with autism [35].",0
"Much like anticonvulsants and other drug exposures, the use of SSRIs in pregnant women and its association to autism have been explored.",0
"Previous studies have shown an increased blood level of serotonin in individuals affected with autism spectrum disorder, warranting the exploration of a possible association [65].",0
"The risk of autism spectrum disorders was shown to be doubled with maternal use of SSRIs in a recent case controlled study of 298 children, with prenatal exposure reported for 20 of those children [36].",0
"This was seen by evaluating medical records, considering both the SSRI exposure and the mental health history of the mother, and pointing to a high association with SSRI treatment and autism during the first trimester.",0
"However, the sample size for this study is small.",0
A recent study conducted in Sweden by Rai et al.,0
"It demonstrated an association between in utero exposure to both SSRIs and nonselective monoamine reuptake inhibitors with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders, particularly without intellectual disability.",0
"However, there is again a limitation with interpreting medical records, such as prescribed versus actual use of SSRIs.",0
"Further, other studies using animal models show that preclinical findings in rodents exposed to SSRIs during development point to an increase in depression and anxiety, exhibiting alteration in social behaviors in the offspring.",0
The data show adverse effects of maternal mental illness on pregnancy outcomes and infant neurodevelopment but are not robust enough to discourage the use of SSRIs during human pregnancy [66].,0
In a study by Gur et al.,0
"[66], it was shown that the manipulation of serotonin during early development in both in vitro and in vivo models disturbs characteristic chemoarchitectural and electrophysiological brain features.",0
These findings indicate that serotonin homeostasis is necessary for proper brain maturation and fetal development.,0
Introduction\nAutism is a complex condition that lacks an established method of prevention; thus there is a need for research to identify its possible causative factors.,0
"Although SSRIs are not contraindicated for use during pregnancy, the effects should be examined more carefully [66].",0
In a similar study done by Simpson et al.,0
"[""[38], animal models were used to study the importance of serotonin homeostasis for the development of rat pups' brains.""]",0
"It was demonstrated that when the serotonin levels were altered by SSRIs during early development of brain structure, the functions were altered.",0
This suggests that SSRIs may have similar effects in human neonates [38].,0
"Conversely, other recent studies have suggested that there may actually not be a strong association between SSRI intake and the subsequent development of autism.",0
"A recent cohort study of live births in Denmark from 1996 to 2005 involving 3,892 cases of ASD found no significant association, as only 52 cases of SSRI use were found [39].",0
Larger observational studies are required to establish a true link between the use of SSRIs and autism.,0
"Furthermore, it must be noted that the effect of depression itself as a factor in autism separate from the administration of SSRIs is a possibility.",0
"Thus, it may be that, in some cases, depression itself or other concomitant factors have a combined effect that is not necessarily due to the use of SSRIs.",0
"Artificial Insemination and Fertility Medications\nThere is an increase in prevalence in the number of women utilizing fertility measures, thus calling for studies to determine the association between assisted reproductive therapy and neurodevelopmental complications, and more specifically autism.",0
A nested case control study done by Lyall et al.,0
[40] shows that assisted reproductive therapy and a history of infertility do not increase the risk for autism spectrum disorders.,0
"However, the age of the mother needs to be taken into consideration, as artificial insemination among older mothers has been studied to lead to more complications.",0
"Women under the age of 35 using fertility therapies such as ovulation inducing drugs and artificial insemination did not increase the risk for having a child with autism, while researchers suggest that the rise in fertility treatments in older women above 35 may increase the risk of having a child with autism for those using artificial insemination and/or ovulation inducing drugs.",0
"While the study is strong in that it uses a large national sample, it is important to note that both diagnoses and fertility treatments were self-reported [40].",0
"Conversely, a recent cohort study conducted by Bay et al.",0
showed a statistically significant increase in autism and other mental health disorders following ovulation induction [41].,0
"The strength in this study includes long followup and low risk of selection bias, but numerous subgroup analyses may lead to risk of chance influencing significant associations.",0
"In an epidemiological study conducted in India by Mamidala et al., maternal hormonal intervention was a significant risk factor for ASD, possibly due to maternal hormone disturbances causing obstetric complications, which in turn are a risk for ASD [42].",0
"While there was a large sample size, there was an absence of detailed information on dosage and frequency of hormonal intervention.",0
"Thus, with differing results it is evident that more specific studies need to be conducted on infertility treatments keeping in mind specific subtypes and their effect on autism in children.",0
Statistical estimates show that one out of every 88 individuals in the United States is diagnosed with autism.,0
"Controls for age can also be accounted for, and adverse effects can be more accurately studied in the future.",0
"Meconium Aspiration Syndrome\nMeconium aspiration syndrome, which occurs when a fetus who is under stress and not getting enough oxygen inhales waste products inside the womb, was linked to a sevenfold increase in the likelihood that a child would later develop autism.",0
A study examined the incidence of autism in the neonatal intensive care unit and risk factors connected with autistic development.,0
Findings in this study indicate that children with autism had a significantly higher history of meconium aspiration syndrome than the controls [43].,0
"However, there is insufficient evidence to implicate any one perinatal or neonatal factor in autism etiology, although there is some evidence to suggest that exposure to a broad class of conditions reflecting general compromises to perinatal and neonatal health may increase the risk.",0
The condition may be defined as a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder that first becomes prevalent in an individual during his/her early childhood.,0
"Therefore meconium aspiration syndrome cannot be the cause of autistic disorder in children, but it can be a contributing factor [57].",0
Birth Weight\nMany studies have evaluated the association between birth weight and the development of autism.,0
"Though this implies a certain etiological premise of difference in gender, it is also important to note that while the population cohort design is strong, there was not a large number overall of the lower birth weight categories in females [44].",0
"An earlier study by Wilkerson supports this finding as it determined that birth weight was a factor for the risk of autism spectrum disorders, with significant associations between autism and gestational age, maternal morphology and intrauterine stress.",0
"Specifically, it is the prescriptions taken during pregnancy, the length of labor, viral infection, abnormal presentation at delivery, and finally low birth weight that were associated with autism.",0
"Consequently, autism results in a patient experiencing a life that is marked by the ongoing challenge of its negative effects on communication and interaction with others.",0
In this study only 183 autistic children were considered and medical conditions of the mother based on a maternal self-report [18].,0
"Further, several studies examined head circumference and height abnormalities in autism patients.",0
"Their studies suggest that the abnormal growth in children with autism spectrum disorders may be related to the causal factors that also increase the risk for ASD, as it was found that children with ASD had proportionally smaller head circumference compared to height during their first year of life, which was absent in premature/low birth weight children with ASD.",0
"Even more importantly, the body grew faster than the head for those with ASD by the end of the first year of life, suggesting a closer following of length to circumference during development.",0
"However, there may have been some recall bias and head circumference could only be measured on the first year of life all within a modest sample size, indicating a need for replicating the study in a larger cohort [45].",0
Similar studies were conducted illustrating that relative microcephaly was more frequent in children with ASD.,0
The disorder is debilitating for the patient and immensely challenging for his/her family.,0
"However microcephaly can also be caused by other factors such as low intelligence and heredity, which could not be controlled for, and also only focused on measurements obtained at birth [46].",0
"Expanding on this, a matched case control studies of children in Stockholm county showed a correlation between low growth for gestation age and preterm birth with ASD combined with intellectual disabilities.",0
The strength of this study lies in its comprehensive sample and size but did not measure some other maternal factors such as substance abuse and nutritional influence [47].,0
Several other studies have focused on maternal changes during pregnancy and their association with autism.,0
"It was found that maternal prenatal weight gain, but not prepregnancy body mass index, is directly related to an increased risk of ASD.",0
"Because of use of cohort and control groups, it not only allowed a representative sample of Utah children, but also as a surveillance study could not directly assess cases and controls [48].",0
"However, a recent longitudinal study using birth data from 4800 children from the United States showed that children born to over-/underweight mothers during prepregnancy had increased incidences of being born with a low birth weight.",0
"The group noted that low birth weight increased chances of developing ASD, as well as rapid head growth.",0
This study concluded that abnormal maternal gestational weight indirectly caused an increased chance of developing ASD [49].,0
"In addition to a lower birth weight population, a secondary analysis longitudinal design study using cranial ultrasound evidence of 14 study participants diagnosed with ASD identified that children with ventricular enlargement were strong indicators of the potential risk for autism spectrum disorders [50].",0
"Labor Induction and Augmentation\nSince the early 1990s, a number of studies have suggested the link between ASD and labor induction, such as the use of oxytocin [67].",0
The research that ensued found significantly different results between population-based studies and clinic based studies.,0
Gardener et al.,0
"[""'s analysis showed induction increase in the risk of autism by 72% in three clinic based studies, while the selected population-based studies reported no association [57].""]",0
"Recently, however, labor induction was positively correlated with autism in a large population study comparing birth records in North Carolina (1990â€“1998) and corresponding school records of autistic children (1997â€“2007).",0
The authors reported that the link was particularly significant in males.,0
"The lack of differentiation of underlying complications in pregnancy, which lead to eventual use of induction, could be the cause of these conflicting findings [51].",0
"summarized causes of prolonged labor, including â€œfetal malposition, fetopelvic disproportion, excess sedation, inadequate contraction, and rupture of fetal membranes before the onset of active labor.â€ However, these complications differ in severity and may require varied quantity of induction agent used at distinctive stages of labor.",0
Further research is necessary to differentiate between the underlying obstetric complications that lead to the eventual use of induction and their respective potential association with autism [52].,0
Labor Time\nA review of literature found limited number of researches on the topic of labor time and autism.,0
The few identified studies abound with conflicting evidence.,0
The research done by Glasson et al.,0
purports that labor duration of less than 1 hour carries an increased risk of developing ASD [8].,0
"On the other hand, Wilkerson et al.",0
found that a prolonged labor (greater than 18â€“24 hours) resulted in an increased risk for autism [18].,0
One of the latest cohort studies on the topic that involved 268 subjects also suggests positive association between prolonged labor and autism [53].,0
"Initial research efforts, which were embarked upon during the 1950s, assert that complications in a given pregnancy, the birthing process, and the incidence of autism are linked.",0
"However, among Gardener et al.",0
"[""'s meta-analysis of nine studies on this subject, five have neutral results, only three have positive association, and one has negative association [57].""]",0
"Current understanding suggests that hypoxia is one of the complications of prolonged labor, along with infection, or head trauma from extended pressure.",0
"[""All of these complications could lead to permanent damages in the neonates' developing brain [52].""]",0
"Neonatal oxygen deprivation can be quantified by several measurements, including low Apgar score, fetal distress, caesarian delivery, threatened abortion, and hemorrhage during pregnancy [68].",0
"Four large cohort studies conducted across Sweden, Australia, and Denmark found that an Apgar score of 7 has a strong predictive value of autism [18,54â€“56]; similar findings were reported by Garderner et al.",0
"Finally, Guinchat et al.",0
"[2] hypothesize that the increased prevalence of autism may be in part due to higher success in obstetric and neonatal care, which resulted in an increased survival rates of hypoxic neonates with brain damage.",0
"In summary, some investigations have shown an association between length of labor and autism, but findings have been inconsistent owing to differences in sampling and methods.",0
"While there is still room for much further research, current understanding suggests that length of labor is possibly associated with autism.",0
"Prolonged delivery due to oversedation, inappropriate position of the fetus, and unbalanced fetopelvic size and oversedation, which results in induction, can play a role.",0
"Over the past several decades, continuing research has been conducted, and much literature has been published that has supported the existence of the links between autism and factors that relate to pre-, peri-, and neonatal care.",0
"It is also possible that children who become autistic may also be slow to deliver that the prolonged delivery is a symptom of, rather than a cause of, autism.",0
"Conclusion\nIn summary, several attributes of the perinatal and labor experiences may be associated with the development of autism.",0
"Yet, importantly, these factors may work separately or may work together with other stimuli.Table 1provides a summary of the findings in the studies explored in this article.",0
"While association between Î² 2 adrenergic receptor agonists and autism spectrum disorders is not strong, exposure to terbutaline during the third trimester has shown to increase incidence.",0
Furthermore terbutaline has been shown to increase microglial activation associated with behavioral abnormalities akin to autism.,0
Labor induction and augmentation appear to be an area of association.,0
"While one study showed that children whose mothers received augmented and/or induced childbirth showed a greater risk for autism compared with controls, further research is needed to prove an association.",0
The role of maternal disease cannot be ignored as antiphospholipid syndrome and perinatal inflammation may have important roles in the eventual development of autism.,0
Antiepileptic drugs and oral supplements may play a role in later onset.,0
"Cocaine has been associated with an increase in the onset of neurodevelopmental abnormalities, but the direct influence on autism development is still lacking.",0
"While a link between smoking and autism could not be established, air pollution may have a role.",0
"Several studies have implicated SSRIs in autism, but a larger recent cohort study showed no association.",0
"Artificial insemination and fertility medications were largely found to have to link, yet reports are conflicted.",0
Prolonged labor may also lead to neurological deficits and thus autism.,0
Attributes of the delivery room and birthing experience also may have a role in autism.,0
"While some evidence suggests that meconium aspiration syndrome may have a link as a contributing factor, more studies are needed.",0
"Such commonly identified, prenatal risk factors may include advanced-aged parents, a short gestation period, low birth weight, hyperbilirubinemia, and breech presentation [3].",0
"Birth weight, gestational age, and preterm birth may correlate with autism and intellectual disabilities.",0
"Another key factor may be the use of any prenatal, prescription medication [4â€“6].",0
"Objective\nTo determine if the effects of HV gestational diets on obesogenic phenotypes in the offspring arise as a consequence of altered hypothalamic control of feeding behavior and if their increased food intake could be prevented by feeding them HV or high folate (10-fold folate, HFol) diets.",0
Hypothalamic Gene Expression\nThe HV but not HFol pup diet brought POMC expression to control levels in mature offspring from HV dams (P=0.004) (Figure 5a).,0
The HV pup diet brought BDNF expression to control levels but the HFol pup diet only attenuated the decrease in expression caused by the HV gestational diet (P=0.02) (Figure 5a).,0
Only the HFol pup diet lowered SeroR2A expression compared to the HV offspring weaned to a RV pup diet (P=0.008) (Figure 5b).,0
There was a trend for lower DopaR1 expression in the HV offspring weaned to a HV pup diet compared to the RV offspring (P=0.06) (Figure 5b).,0
Folate Status\nBoth brain (Figure 6a) and plasma (Figure 6b) folate levels were unaffected by the diets of the dams but were elevated by the high multivitamin or high folate pup diet.,0
"DISCUSSION\nOur findings support the hypothesis that HV or HFol pup diet prevents the increase in food intake, body weight and glucose response to a glucose load in offspring of the HV dams, possibly by post-weaning changes in food intake regulatory systems.",0
The HFol pup diet partially brought BDNF to the control level (P=0.02) and lowered SeroR2A (P=0.008).,0
"Although the role of hypothalamic regulation in determining the phenotype is uncertain, our gene expression data are novel because we show that feeding neurocircuitry undergoes modification both in utero and into maturity.",0
Two lines of evidence support the PAR hypothesis.,0
"First, an unmatched RV post-weaning diet fed the offspring born to HV dams resulted in increased food intake and characteristics of the metabolic syndrome, as observed previously.4Second, the HV and HFol post-weaning diets prevented these effects.",0
"Conclusion\nThe obesogenic phenotype in offspring from HV fed dams is prevented by feeding HV or HFol pup diets, possibly due to post-weaning modulation of food intake regulatory mechanisms.",0
"There were significant effect of both diet and time, but no interaction between them on food intake and weight gain, suggesting that vitamin diets strongly alter the phenotype of mature offspring independent of time.",0
"Because the negative consequences of the HV gestational diet on food intake, weight gain and glucose control were prevented by feeding either the HV or HFol pup diets, these observations support the PAR hypothesis that offspring fed diets similar to their mothers lead to a more appropriate adaptation to their postnatal environment compared to those fed an unmatched diet.",0
"Elevated folate levels in the brain and plasma at maturity confirmed the folate content of the HV and HFol post-weaning diets, and importantly, revealed that the brain responds to the post-weaning diet.",0
"Although the HV and HFol post-weaning diets had similar effects on food intake, weight gain and blood glucose response by preventing the negative consequences of the HV gestational diet, they differed in their impact on expression in food intake regulatory genes in the hypothalamus.",0
"INTRODUCTION\nDiets consumed during pregnancy and early postnatal life shape the developmental trajectory of the offspring.1,2Although vitamins contribute to all phases of development,3the effects of multivitamin consumption above requirements (but at non-toxic levels) during pregnancy as determinants of physiologic phenotypes of the offspring have received little attention.",0
"Overall the data support the hypothesis that the cause of the phenotype of HV offspring fed RV diets may be accounted for by its effects in utero on development of hypothalamic pathways of intake regulation, leading to excess food intake, and consequently increased body weight and characteristics of the metabolic syndrome.4Offspring born to dams fed the HV diet during pregnancy had lower expression of POMC and BDNF, which are anorexigenic (appetite-suppressing) genes,20,21compared to those born to dams on the RV diet.",0
Lower expression of the anorexigenic genes in the offspring of dams fed the multivamins during pregnancy is consistent with the observed increased food intake.,0
Our results are consistent with other data showing that early nutrition alters the central appetite regulatory network.22Effects of the maternal diet on the hypothalamic expression of food intake regulatory pathways were found in lambs of ewes fed a diet that exceeded their energy requirement.,0
"These lambs were fatter but had higher hypothalamic POMC expression at postnatal day 30 and relative milk intake of these lambs was not different from those born to control-fed mothers after the third postnatal week.23In contrast, the data from the present study show that higher food intake in adulthood of offspring born to the HV dams and fed the RV diet is consistent with their lower expression of anorexigenic neuropeptides in the hypothalamus.",0
"However, there was no gestational HV diet effect on expression of leptin and insulin receptors, which are known to modulate expression of orexigenic and anorexigenic neurons regulating energy intake.24â€“26Despite this lack of difference, other neurons downstream regulating food intake such as POMC and BDNF may be affected by the high vitamin diets.",0
A novel observation of our study is that the hypothalamic feeding pathways respond to the vitamin content of the post-weaning diet.,0
"Because expression of these anorexigenic neuropeptides was normalized, it may be suggested that vitamin content of post-weaning diets contribute to remodeling of hypothalamic functioning in mature as well as developing rats.",0
"Furthermore, there was a trend for lower expression of DopaR1 in the HV offspring weaned to a HV diet compared to the control offspring.",0
"In the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, dopamine release is required to initiate a meal, and is positively associated with meal number and duration.27,28By possibly reducing dopamine signaling, the HV pup diet may have provided some protection against excess food intake caused by the HV gestational diet.",0
"Although we are the first to show that the brain at maturity responds to vitamins, our results are substantiated by a report of hypothalamic changes in the food intake regulatory genes due to the interaction of maternal and post-weaning diets high in saturated fats in male offspring.29\nSurprisingly, a ten-fold addition of folate alone to the RV diet modified some of the effects of the maternal HV diet on the offspring, suggesting a possible primary role for this methyl group vitamin.",0
"A significant role for folate in the complete vitamin mixture in determining the effect of the HV diet was supported by the reductions in food intake, body weight and blood glucose.",0
"However, folate had fewer effects on the hypothalamus of offspring born to HV dams.",0
"Because POMC was not brought to control levels, vitamins other than folate may play a role in correcting POMC.",0
"The HFol pup diet reduced SeroR2A expression in mature offspring of the dams fed the HV diet, but not by the HV pup diet (Figure 5b).",0
"BDNF was corrected to similar levels by the HV diet, and only partially by the HFol pup diet.",0
"We have shown recently that feeding a diet containing 10-fold the recommended multivitamin content (HV) to Wistar rats during pregnancy results in increased food intake, obesity and characteristics of the metabolic syndrome in both adult male4and female5offspring weaned to the recommended vitamin (RV) diet.",0
"Previous studies have shown that BDNF increases serotonin turnover in the hypothalamus,30,31suggesting that the effect of gestational and post-weaning diets on BDNF mRNA levels may explain some compensatory response in SeroR2A expression.",0
The fact that we did not observe differences in other subtypes of SeroR may indicate that SeroR2A is more sensitive to BDNF-induced changes by the vitamin diets.,0
"Because BDNF may be differentially expressed in specific regions of the hypothalamus, where high levels are present in the ventromedial hypothalamus,32the relationship between BDNF and SeroR is unknown from whole hypothalamus in our study.",0
"Although folate has been shown to be an active participant in methyltransfer reactions,12global methylation was not affected by either the gestational or post-weaning diet.",0
"However this is not surprising because previous studies have reported that DNA methylation of genes in the absence of a detectable change in global methylation, suggesting that epigenetic changes are site-specific.33In addition, the RV, HV and HFol diets in our study contain high amounts of choline, which is another factor affecting DNA methylation,34,35and it alone may have obscured detection of the effect of folate on methylation.",0
The metabolism of choline and other methyl group vitamins (ie.,0
"folate, vitamin B6 and B12) is closely linked.36\nA significant weakness of the study arises from the lack of measurement of gene expression at different stages of maturity.",0
"The effect of high vitamin maternal diets on chronic disease in the offspring can be attributed primarily to epigenetic modulation of gene expression leading to programming of regulatory systems.11Because methyl group vitamins, and specifically folate, have been shown to participate in epigenetic changes through its functions in DNA methylation,12we also fed offspring a high folate (HFol) diet.",0
"Because the hypothalamus is an important regulator of food intake and appetite control,6it can be hypothesized that the HV diet alters development of feeding neurocircuitry in the offspring resulting in an obesogenic phenotype.",0
"Thus, we do not know the stage of maturation when the post-weaning diets altered the hypothalamus.",0
"In addition to hypothalamic genes, measurement of genes in regions of the brain involved in reward and motivation may have contributed to a fuller understanding of the overall impact of the diets on regulation of food intake.",0
"It has been shown that mice fed post-weaning a high fat diet (60% calories from fat) had lower expression of the Î¼-opioid receptor gene which influences reward circuitry in the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex.37\nIn conclusion, the obesogenic phenotype in offspring from HV fed dams may be a consequence of altered hypothalamic control of feeding behavior but can be prevented by feeding them HV or HFol pup diets.",0
"Disordered regulation of feeding pathways can affect growth and metabolism, consequently driving the appearance of metabolic syndrome later in life.7,8\nAn extension of the concept that early life factors contribute to chronic diseases is described by the predictive adaptive response (PAR) hypothesis, which suggests that a mismatch between in utero and postnatal environment increases the risk of developing disease in adulthood.9,10It has been proposed that the offspring modify their phenotype based on their in utero environment in order to adapt to the predicted postnatal setting.",0
"Based on the PAR hypothesis, the high multivitamin gestational diet would lead to developmental adaptation in the offspring consistent with a high vitamin post-weaning environment.",0
"If so, it would be predicted that it is this mismatch between the HV diet fed to the dams and the vitamin content of diets fed to the offspring that leads to an obesogenic phenotype.",0
"Therefore, we hypothesized that the effects of HV gestational diets on obesogenic phenotype in the offspring arise as a consequence of altered hypothalamic control of feeding behavior and these effects could be prevented by feeding them HV or HFol diets.",0
"Our primary objective was to compare the effects of RV, HV and HFol pup diets on food intake, body weight, glucose control and hypothalamic gene expression of feeding neuropeptides in offspring born to HV dams with offspring born to RV dams and weaned to RV diet.",0
The acceptance capacity of methyl groups in the whole genome is known to be inversely related to the exogenous3H-methyl incorporation.,0
"In contrast, male offspring from the HV dams weaned to either the HFol or HV pup diet did not differ in food intake, weight gain and glucose response compared to those from the RV dams (Figure 2,3,4).",0
A randomized controlled trial of vitamin D supplementation on perinatal depression: in Iranian pregnant mothers\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nMood disorders in pregnancy and post-partum period are common and considered as a public health issue.,0
"Therefore, the brain can regionally activate vitamin D, which implicates vitamin Dâ€™s role in brain function more prominent [22â€“25].",0
"Studies have shown that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration is associated with psychological symptoms like anxiety, depression and reduced cognitive function [26,27].",0
"Few case reports have suggested an interaction between season or latitude and psychological problems [28,29].",0
"Researchers have studied the relationship between low serum vitamin D concentration and perinatal depression, although no clinical trial has been conducted on vitamin Dâ€™s effects on depression related to childbirth.",0
"In a study by Mozaffari- Khosravi et al., high doses of vitamin D have been effective in men and women who were depressed [30].",0
Li et al.,0
suggested that more accurate clinical trials are required to reach a conclusion about the effectiveness of vitamin D on depression [31].,0
"Considering the possible connection between low serum vitamin D and depression, researchers studied the relationship between low vitamin D and perinatal depression.",0
Murphy et al.,0
"in a study with a small sample size (97\xa0participants), observed an association between maternal low serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and high depression scores within several post-partum visits [32].",0
Robinson et al.,0
studied the relationship between the maternal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations measured in the 18thweek of gestation and postnatal depression in 796 people.,0
They found that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in the second trimester were a risk factor for postnatal depression.,0
This study evaluated the effect of vitamin D3supplementation on perinatal depression scores.,0
Brandenburg et al.,0
studied the association between maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and antenatal depression.,0
It has been shown that mothers with higher depression scores had lower levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D compared to who had lower depression scores [34].,0
"On the contrary to the above mentioned studies, Neilson et al., in a caseâ€“control study, found that an increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D level can enhance the possibility of postnatal depression.",0
"They have stated that, these unexpected results could be due to genetic differences which lead to a disturbance in conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D into its active form, calcitriol [35].",0
"According to our knowledge, there was no clinical trial that has evaluated the effectiveness of vitamin D on perinatal depression.",0
"Hence, we aimed this study to assess the effectiveness of vitamin D3supplementation on antenatal and postnatal depression levels.",0
Advantage of this questionnaire is that it focuses on psychological signs of depression rather than physical signs [36].,0
"After that, several studies have validated its use throughout the antenatal period [37â€“39].",0
"In western studies, this questionnaire has had high reliability and validity [40,41].",0
"Cut-off points with values more than 9, 12, 13, and 14 were used in different studies to determine perinatal depression [37,43,44].",0
"In the present study, we used the cut-off point of\u2009>\u200913 as greater likelihood of having depression disorder, according to Mazhari and Nakhaeeâ€™s study in Iranian population [42].",0
Results\nThe two groups were similar in relation to baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations.,0
"Therefore, at baseline we excluded those mothers with the EPDS scores of >13 and they were referred to a psychologist for further evaluation and management.",0
The cut-off points of <9 and 9â€“13 were used as low and moderate risk for depression.,0
"According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), we considered vitamin D deficiency as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of less than 20\xa0ng/ml.",0
"We also considered vitamin D insufficiency as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of 21â€“29\xa0ng/ml, and the participants who had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of\u2009â‰¥\u200930\xa0ng/ml as sufficient [19,46].",0
"Intervention in the supplement consumer (vitamin D) group: In 2007 and 2010, the Canadian Pediatric Association recommended a daily amount of 2000\xa0IU of vitamin D for pregnant and breast-feeding women [47,46].",0
"Therefore, this group received two 1000 unit vitamin D3pills (Totally 2000\xa0IU) daily from the 26â€“28 weeks of gestation until childbirth.",0
"In Iran, iron and folic acid supplements are routinely given to all pregnant mothers and some mothers based on doctorsâ€™ order may consume multivitamins or calcium.",0
The multivitamin supplementations contained 200â€“400\xa0IU of vitamin D.\n\nSample size and statistical analysis\nWe could not find a similar study to use its means for determining the sample size.,0
"Therefore, considering the following values: effect size\u2009=\u20090.5, Î±\u2009=\u20090.05, Î²\u2009=\u20090.20, to the power of 80\xa0% and using the formula (16/âˆ†2, âˆ†\u2009=\u20090.05), the sample size was estimated at 64 in each group.",0
"However, at childbirth, the vitamin D group had significantly higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration in comparison to the control group ( p\u2009<\u20090.001 ).",0
"Considering the possible losses, the sample size was set at 74 people in each group finally.",0
We conducted stratified analyses by parity status to assess whether the trend of effectiveness is different among the two nulliparous and multiparous subgroups.,0
16/169 women did not refer to the lab.,0
Another significant factor for sample loss was that a number of the women did not return to the specified hospital for childbirth.,0
"However, they were different regarding to using other supplements outside the studyâ€™s protocol and planned pregnancy (Table\xa01).",0
"Only, 4 women (2.2\xa0%) were sufficient (25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration of â‰¥\u200930\xa0ng/mL).",0
"While, the mean depression scores were significantly lower in the vitamin D group than the control one at 38â€“40 weeks of gestation ( p \u2009=\u20090.01) also, at 4 and 8 weeks after birth ( p \u2009>\u20090.001) (Table\xa03).",0
"Results showed that in the vitamin D group the number of participants with depression scores of <9 were more than the control group at 38â€“40 weeks of gestation also, at 4 and 8 weeks after birth (Table\xa03).",0
The repeated measures analysis showed that the control group had gone through significant changes with regards to depression scores ( p \u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.,0
"However, the scores at 4 and 8 weeks after birth were lower than the baseline depression scores (( p \u2009=\u20090.048 and p \u2009=\u20090.014, respectively).",0
"2\n\nWithin groups comparison related to depression scores: The results showed, between the two groups, the difference regards to over-time reduction of depression scores was significant ( p \u2009<\u20090.001)\nThe vitamin D group also had gone through changes with regards to their depression scores ( p \u2009<\u20090.001) (Fig.",0
"Pairwise comparisons showed that the scores at 38â€“40 weeks, 4 and 8 weeks postpartum were significantly lower than the baseline depression scores ( p \u2009<\u20090.001).",0
"However, the depression scores at 4 and 8 weeks after birth were not different significantly ( p \u2009=\u20090.217).",0
"The results showed that in both subgroups, the vitamin D group had statistically significant higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations at childbirth and lower depression score at 4 and 8 weeks postpartum than the control group (Table\xa04).",0
"While, any statistically significant differences were not observed regarding to depression scores at 38â€“40 weeks of gestation (Table\xa04).",0
Conclusions\nThe present trial showed that consuming 2000\xa0IU vitamin D3daily during late pregnancy was effective in decreasing perinatal depression levels.,0

Discussion\nThis clinical trial evaluated the effect of 2000\xa0IU of vitamin D3supplement per day during late pregnancy on perinatal depression.,0
"According to our knowledge, this study was the first trial held on vitamin D and perinatal depression.",0
"Results showed that at baseline, in 72.8\xa0% of the participants, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were lower than20 ng/mL.",0
They were suffering from vitamin D deficiency based on new perspective towards normal serum vitamin D concentration [46].,0
"Although 67.3\xa0% of the blood samples were taken in the winter, 81\xa0% of the participants were exposed to sunlight or had outdoor activities for at least 15\xa0min per day.",0
"Considering the factors affecting vitamin D production such as clothing type, skin color and the time of day being exposed to the sun [48â€“50], these results are justifiable.",0
We suggest further clinical trial in pregnant mothers who are at risk for postnatal depression.,0
"Vitamin D deficiency is a widespread global problem, which even can observe in the countries which get enough sunlight [49,51].",0
The high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Iran was showed in numerous studies.,0
"Saki et al., showed high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in southern Iranian children, more than 80\xa0% were deficient [53].",0
"Also, Omani et al.",0
"found vitamin D deficiency in 52.9\xa0% of women aged 20â€“74 years in Shiraz, Iran [54].",0
"In the present study, the mean vitamin D concentrations in vitamin D group were significantly higher after taking 2000\xa0IU of vitamin D supplementation per day for at least 8 weeks.",0
"Nonetheless, only 9.7\xa0% in the vitamin D group achieved serum concentrations higher than 30\xa0ng/mL.",0
"In contrast, in the previous studies 2000\xa0IU vitamin D supplementation was more sufficient to increase serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations up to the adequate amount (â‰¥32\xa0ng/mL) [18,57,58].",0
"In those studies, vitamin D supplementations started at the end of the first trimester or at the beginning of the second trimester and their participants had higher initial 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations compared to the participants in our study.",0
"The spread and importance of postpartum depression have led researchers to create preventative methods such as educational programs, modified care, dietary supplements, antidepressant medication and social support [12â€“14].",0
"The participants who had depression scores of >13 were exited from this clinical trial and referred to psychiatrist for further assessment and treatment, because, the nature of our study was preventative than management.",0
"Previous clinical trials, in which vitamin D supplementations were consumed during pregnancy [18,58], have not evaluated the antenatal and postnatal depression disorders.",0
"In contrast, in another study 40,000\xa0IU vitamin D per week was used for 6\xa0months, but vitamin D was not effective in decreasing depression level compared to the control group [68].",0
"Therefore, it is justifiable that in our study, vitamin D group had lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration compared to those were in the study by Taheri et al.",0
"Considering cut-off point of â‰¥9, data analysis showed that a lot of participants (more than 50\xa0%) were susceptible to prenatal depression at 26â€“28 weeks.",0
"In previous studies, the prevalence of antenatal depression had been studied, using various tools and cut-off points.",0
"Depression was reported in 8.6\xa0% of European mothers, in 19.5\xa0% of Middle Eastern mothers, and in 17.5\xa0% of South Asian mothers.",0
"However, the EPDS has been widely used in screening, not providing a diagnosis, for perinatal depression, it has been reported that its score is highly correlated with physician diagnostic opinion.",0
"Several studies have been shown that, with cutoff score of 12â€“13, this scale develops into more indicative in identifying real depression in women [36,37,42].",0
Background\nMood disorders in pregnancy and post-partum period are common and considered as a public health issue.,0
"While in a study by Cassidy- Bushrow et al., in African-American women, an inverse relationship was observed between maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration at the early stages of pregnancy and antenatal depression.",0
"There was an inverse relationship between the vitamin D logarithm and depression scores, as by adding one unit to the vitamin D concentration logarithm, equal to 2.72\xa0ng/mL, a 46\xa0% reduction in the depression scores occurred [63].",0
"In another study in US, in 498 pregnant mothers with the mean gestational age of 15\xa0weeks, generally there was an inverse relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and depression level.",0
It is worth mentioning that their tools for determining depression were different than ours.,0
It was a possible reason that we did not observe any relationship between antenatal depression score and 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration.,0
"Also in our study, selection of participants at the beginning was through convenience method.",0
"Surprisingly, the change in vitamin D concentration (baseline to childbirth) was not correlated with changes in depression scores from baseline to 38â€“40 weeks of gestation or to 4 and 8 weeks postpartum.",0
The present trial showed that consuming 2000\xa0IU vitamin D3per day in late pregnancy was effective in decreasing depression scores in perinatal period.,0
The vitamin D and control groups were similar regarding to general characteristics except for two variables: unplanned pregnancy and using other supplements out of the studyâ€™s protocol.,0
Previous studies reported that unplanned pregnancy is a risk factor for perinatal depression.,0
"Nonetheless, in our study, the vitamin D group had significantly lower depression scores after intervention.",0
The effectiveness of calcium supplementation on prevention of perinatal depression has been shown in a previous study [65].,0
"The control group consumed extra supplements such as calcium more frequently, nonetheless this group had significantly higher depression scores compared to vitamin D group.",0
"However in a cross-sectional study in Japan, higher dietary vitamin D intake was independently associated with a lower prevalence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy [66].",0
"In recent decades researchers have paid great amount of attention to these subjects and showed that mood illness related to childbirth can lead to serious complications for mother, fetus, newborn and family [1,2].",0
"On the other hand, the effect of vitamin D on depression in non-pregnant people are not entirely clear.",0
Some clinical trials in non-pregnant people showed that vitamin D was effective in decreasing depression level.,0
"In a study by Mozafari- Khosravi et al., 300,000 and 150,000\xa0IU vitamin D were administered by injection to the two groups who suffered depression and the third group did not receive vitamin D. High doses of vitamin D were effective in decreasing depression levels after 3\xa0months [30].",0
Dean et al.,0
found that 5000\xa0IU vitamin D per day for 6\xa0weeks had no effect on men and womenâ€™s cognitive and emotional function [69].,0
Vitamin D can affect brain function in several ways.,0
"The existence of receptors for the active form of vitamin D (1, 25(OH)2D) in the brain induces a direct effect.",0
Its indirect effects are attributed to vitamin Dâ€™s effects on improvement of muscle activities.,0
"As a result of this improvement, physical activity increases and this have positive effects on health.",0
An increase in vitamin D can cause parathyroid hormones to decrease.,0
"An increase in this hormone can lead to brain dysfunctions [70,71].",0
"On the other hand, cytokines are messengers produced by immune cells which affect all tissues, including brain.",0
"Nowadays, we know that brain cells such as microglia and astrocytes, can secrete cytokines.",0
Vitamin D may act as an anti-inflammatory agent in the brain by keeping harmful pro-inflammatory cytokines in check.,0
Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to pro-inflammatory disease.,0
"It is also possible that as a result of vascular changes in pregnancy the maternal cerebral environment is more vulnerable to inflammation perhaps, explaining in part the link between vitamin D and depression in pregnancy.",0
"In light of the inflammatory nature of depression and the strong role of vitamin D as an anti-inflammatory and immunomodulator, inflammation may mediate the relationship between vitamin D deficiency and depression during pregnancy [73,74].",0
"Previous studies have suggested that perinatal depression is more frequent and serious in primiparous women than multiparous women [75,76].",0
It was interesting to investigate trend of vitamin D effectiveness in the two primiparous and multiparous subgroups.,0
The findings were similar to the overall population except one thing.,0
Staying on vitamin D consumption until childbirth resulted in higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration that induced the effect on postnatal depression exceeding than prenatal depression.,0
A difference in nature of antenatal depression compared to postnatal depression can reflect another possible reason for achieving this result.,0
Evidence shows that postnatal depression is an extension of antenatal depression which continues postpartum.,0
Depression scores decreased in the both our groups over time which indicates that depression could be more critical during pregnancy than postpartum period.,0
The pleasant feeling of motherhood can probably play a role in decreasing depression specially in primiparous mothers [77].,0
"During pregnancy, women are worried about risks to their own and the fetus health.",0
Fear of labor pain is another concern of the modern-day mothers [78].,0
"Therefore, a decreased perinatal depression level is justifiable.",0
"On the other hand, the difference between the two groups was meaningful concerning over-time reduction of depression.",0
"Meaning that over time, depression scores decreased much more in the vitamin D group in comparison to control group and this shows the possible effects of the vitamin D3supplementation.",0
Another finding of this study was that vitamin D3supplementation was effective in decreasing depression level in both nulliparous and multiparous subgroups.,0
"This problem can have negative effects on infant development and can cause behavioral, cognitive, social and emotional problems in infant which could continue throughout childhood [3â€“5].",0
"Therefore, the participantsâ€™ honesty was one of this research limits.",0
This group of participants may not be representative of the target population.,0
"Since mothers with depression level of >13 were excluded from this study, the results can not extend to mothers with high levels of depression.",0
"Also, since more than 95\xa0% of the mothers had lower than 30\xa0ng/mL serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration, it is not clear if the same results would be observed in mothers with higher levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Therefore, we suggest further clinical trials, using 2000\xa0IU vitamin D on a larger population, mothers with high levels of depression, and high serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations.",0
"The last weakness of this study was that it had the statistical authority to identify differences in depressive symptoms, but not in the diagnoses of major depressive disorder.",0
"Conclusion\nIn the present study, it was observed that 2000\xa0IU vitamin D3per day for at least 8 weeks during late pregnancy, can be effective in decreasing perinatal depression levels (at 38â€“40 weeks of gestation also, at 4 and 8 weeks after birth).",0
Prevalence of postpartum depression varies throughout the world; however researchers have used different scales and cut off points to describe this psychological disorder.,0
This study has reported the prevalence of postnatal depression up to 60\xa0% [6].,0
"The prevalence of postnatal depression in some Asian countries has been reported between 22 and 46.9\xa0% [7,8].",0
Several studies have shown a high prevalence of postnatal depression in Iran.,0
"In the meta-analysis of Veisani et al., postnatal depression was reported at 25.3\xa0% [9], and in two recent studies in eastern and central part of Iran, the prevalence has been reported at 28.9â€“34.8\xa0% [10,11].",0
"While, the circulating half-life of 1, 25(OH) 2D is around 4\xa0h. Its blood concentration is 1000 times less than 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Serum levels of PTH, calcium, and phosphate have influence on regulatory and production of 1,25(OH)2D.",0
Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D reflects the bodyâ€™s vitamin D reserves and this is a well-known indicator for examining vitamin D status [15].,0
"Several studies have revealed that vitamin D supplementation can raise vitamin D reserves gradually, according to baseline concentration of vitamin D, dose and duration of consumption [16â€“18].",0
"In accordance to a guideline by Holick et al., 6â€“8 weeks consumption of a high dose vitamin D supplement are essential to obtain an adequate blood reserves of vitamin D [19].",0
"It seems that in addition to calcium homeostasis and bone health, vitamin D is also essential for brain development and function [20,21].",0
"Environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity: potential public health concerns\n\nAbstractAbstract\nThroughout our lives, epigenetic processes shape our development and enable us to adapt to a constantly changing environment.",0
"This review, therefore, examines the present understanding of epigenetic mechanisms involved in the mammalian life cycle, evaluates the current evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity in human cohorts and rodent models and highlights the research considerations and implications of this emerging knowledge for public health and regulatory toxicology.",0
"These were then further evaluated and collated to provide a critical review that summarizes the main epigenetic mechanisms important during the mammalian life cycle, evaluates the current evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity in human cohorts and rodents models, and highlights the research considerations and implications of this emerging knowledge for public health and regulatory toxicology.",0
"This view of epigenetically mediated phenotypic plasticity falls into the realms of Lamarckian inheritance, the idea that an organism can pass on acquired characteristics to future offspring.",0
"The benefits of such inheritance are obvious and even Darwin himself proposed a hypothetical mechanism for the transmission of somatic tissue characteristics via the germ cells to subsequent generations, which he termed pangenesis (Darwin1868).",0
"Indeed, not all environmentally induced epigenetic changes have proved detrimental.",0
Hughes et\xa0al.,0
(2009) reported that calorie restriction during adolescence and young adulthood as a result of the Dutch Hunger Winter was associated with altered DNA methylation and reduced risk of colorectal cancer in later life.,0
Tyagi et\xa0al.,0
(2015) described a protective effect of early ( in utero through lactation) exposure to dietary omega-3 fatty acids on neuroplasticity in rats that involved specific changes in DNA methylation.,0
Such benefits are not just limited to nutrition; advantageous chemically induced epigenetic changes have also been reported.,0
Zeybel et\xa0al.,0
(2012) demonstrated a beneficial heritable histone modification-mediated reprograming of hepatic wound healing in male rats that reduced fibrotic scarring in the subsequent offspring of rats treated with the hepatotoxin carbon tetrachloride.,0
"In addition, it is possible to have adverse outcomes that are reversible.",0
"Indeed, Nishihara et\xa0al.",0
"(2013) provided epidemiological data to support the benefits of smoking cessation, with DNA methylation-related colon cancer risk reverting back to that of non-smokers within 10 years of cessation.",0
"Thus, the reversibility of environmentally induced changes is also critically important when determining the true potential adversity of an environmental exposure.",0
"Such findings, both positive and negative, have been incorporated into UK governmental advice and recommendations (Boyd et\xa0al.2013).",0
"Furthermore, epigenetic changes may themselves have no consequences on gene expression (as demonstrated in a recent in vitro study by Ramos et\xa0al.",0
"Thus, environmentally induced epigenetic changes may not always be mechanistically involved in adverse effects; instead, they may act as markers of past exposures (Bakulski & Fallin2014), or represent adaptations involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis.",0
Such changes may still prove useful for regulatory purposes and also do not rule out the possibility of later onset effects.,0
"For example, robust epigenetic changes induced by environmental exposures in the absence of a phenotypic consequence essentially become the â€˜new normalâ€™ epigenome, which could have greater susceptibility to disease development and/or future exposures (as demonstrated in two in vivo rat models (Greathouse et\xa0al.2012; Wong et\xa0al.2015)).",0
Characterizing normal variation within the epigenome between non-disease states would provide valuable data to begin establishing limits of epignetic change above which cellular homeostasis fails and epigenetic toxicity is induced.,0
The considerable inter- and intra-human/mammalian variation combined with the vast number of potential epigenetic changes make this a very challenging task.,0
"However, defining the limits of normal variation for specific epigenetic changes of relevance would be a sensible and pragmatic starting point.",0
"[""Environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity is an issue that has been highlighted as a current research focus within Public Health Englandâ€™s (PHE's) Center for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards (CRCE), the wider PHE organization as part of the early life priority â€˜ensuring every child has the best start in lifeâ€™, and the international research and governmental communities.""]",0
Priority questions : What is the â€˜normalâ€™ epigenome?,0
What are the real short- and/or long-term consequence(s) of environmentally induced epigenetic change(s)?,0
Implications for regulatory toxicology and intervention\nAll the previous considerations are vital for effective regulatory toxicology and potential intervention.,0
"A robust, dose-dependent, causal relationship among a specific environmental exposure, an epigenetic change and an adverse public health outcome is required to classify a chemical as an epigenetic toxicant.",0
"While a similar robust, dose-dependent relationship is also crucial to facilitate the development of testing methods for hazard assessment, relevant environmental regulation and/or appropriate medical intervention, establishing causality is not necessarily essential.",0
"Epigenetic changes that act as markers of exposure and/or predictors of future toxicity, but do not in themselves directly induce an adverse effect, may also be useful in risk assessment and intervention.",0
As yet there is no precedent for epigenetically mediated toxicity in chemical regulation.,0
"However, environmental exposures during critical windows of human development and subsequent non-genotoxic/epigenetic changes that may lead to later life adverse health outcomes (such as obesity, diabetes and cancer) across multiple generations continues to be of high concern for all the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries, the International Agency on Research for Cancer (IARC) and the European Commission (EFSA2013; Greally & Jacobs2013; Herceg et\xa0al.2013; OECD2014).",0
Epigenetics thus offers an opportunity for improved chemical regulation and public health protection.,0
"For example, epigenetic changes have the potential to provide (1) more sensitive/earlier end points of toxicity within existing regulatory test guidelines (TGs), (2) novel markers of exposure/predictors of future toxicity for the development of in vitro chemical screening assays and (3) novel end points of toxicities for which we are currently rarely able to conduct definitive regulatory testing due to animal welfare, cost and time considerations (such as non-genotoxic carcinogens, multigenerational toxicity and chronic low-dose exposures that impact health in later life).",0
"By identifying and contributing to the knowledge gaps PHE, and similar organizations worldwide, can ensure that they stay fully aware of the current situation and are in the best position to give advice and put forward any necessary recommendations and policies to protect public health against such toxicity.",0
"As such, epigenetics is high on the agenda of the OECD expert working group on an integrated approach to testing and assessment (IATA) for non-genotoxic carcinogens (NGTxC) and the OECD endocrine disrupters testing and assessment advisory group (EDTA AG) (Greally & Jacobs2013; Jacobs et\xa0al.2015).",0
"The interest of OECD member countries in epigenetics within the former expert group is particularly strong, where epigenetic mechanisms are playing a pivotal role in the development of tools for improved chemical safety assessment (Jacobs et\xa0al.2015).",0
"Thus, the incorporation of epigenetics within chemical regulation could ultimately reduce animal usage and the time and cost of chemical research and development, while simultaneously improving the protection of public health worldwide.",0
"The current body of evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity is predominantly a collection of human epidemiological data and exploratory in vivo high (often single) dose range studies, performed, not for regulatory purposes, but to investigate the theoretical potential and putative mechanisms of epigenetic toxicity in biological systems.",0
"Nevertheless, such studies have helped to identify putative markers and assays that may be useful for biomonitoring such exposures and toxicities, and testing the epigenetic toxicity potential of environmental exposures, respectively.",0
Those that may be of particular interest for development into regulatory strategies/procedures are presented inTables 1and2.,0
"A number of reporter mouse models, including the Agouti Avy , CabpIAP and AuxinFu , have also been used to investigate environmentally induced epigenetic changes in in vivo exploratory research (Dolinoy et\xa0al.2007; Waterland et\xa0al.2006; Rosenfeld2010).",0
The Avy model in particular has been put forward as a potential epigenetic toxicological tool (Dolinoy2008; Rosenfeld2010; Faulk et\xa0al.2013).,0
"However, the suitability of the Avy mouse as a true reporter model has since been questioned following both lack of reproducibility (Rosenfeld et\xa0al.2013), and the suggestion that it may possess a â€œthriftyâ€ genotype, naturally predisposing offspring to a metabolic syndrome when food is plentiful, thus confounding results following environmental exposures (Greally & Jacobs2013).",0
"The AxinFu mouse may, therefore, represent a more promising reporter model in the development of regulatory toxicological assays for potential environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity.",0
"In addition, current OECD human health-related TGs have the potential for adaptation to incorporate adverse epigenetic endpoints (Greally & Jacobs2013).",0
"Inclusion of such endpoints as non-compulsory measurements would (1) encourage better use of existing studies by adding a valuable non-genotoxic/epigenetic component that is not currently included, (2) provide an extensive sample resource and (3) initiate the collection of epigenetic data in a regulatory context.",0
This would begin to address regulatory concerns and help to develop formal epigenetically relevant toxicity TGs.,0
Such an approach would also respect the 3Rs.,0
"An overview of the relevant TGs that could be explored for adaptation (updated from Greally & Jacobs2013), is provided inTable 3.",0
These include not only the in vitro endocrine TGs and in vivo reproductive and developmental TGs (Greally & Jacobs2013) but also a newly revised genotoxicity TG (TG 483) where spermatogonal samples could be further utilized for RNA analyzes (Linschooten et\xa0al.2009; Marczylo et\xa0al.2012; Metzler-Guillemain et\xa0al.2015).,0
"The potential for such adaptations is already acknowledged at the OECD, but more applied development of key markers and subsequent validation work is needed to formally incorporate epigenetic endpoints into TGs.",0
Similar discussions on the incorporation of epigenetic toxicity into the regulatory framework are also a current focus of industry supported workshops (van Ravenzwaay et\xa0al.2014; ECETOC2016; Miousse et\xa0al.2015).,0

"When considering temporal aspects to reproductive, developmental and endocrine disrupting effects, the TGs currently in use may not incorporate either the most relevant life stage(s), the most sensitive endpoints for epigenetic perturbation and/or sufficient duration of observation to detect later-onset effects.",0
"Thus, it is likely that the full spectrum of potential effects will not be identified.",0
"While some tests in the OECD Conceptual Framework do cover exposure during critical periods of development in utero , to date, they may not address effects that might be induced by exposure during neonatal or pubertal development, and/or emerge during later life stages.",0
"For regulatory purposes, there are major limitations to simply extending lifetime rodent studies beyond the standard 2 years to examine later-onset epigenetic adverse outcomes, including financial, ethical and scientific considerations.",0
"In addition to the increased costs and animal welfare issues associated with housing and monitoring up to the natural death of the animals, there is also the confounding factor of increased background pathology with age.",0
"Infectious pathologies and increased incidences of certain tumor types, such as pituitary tumors or lymphomas/leukaemias, are known to occur with increasing age, and the high spontaneous incidences of leukemias/lymphomas and mammary gland tumors in laboratory animals from inbred colonies are known to vary considerably between studies (Innes et\xa0al.1967; Greaves2000).",0
"Thus, an overview of non-neoplastic, pre-neoplastic, neoplastic and benign pathologies within each model system is essential for the accurate interpretation of life-long rodent studies.",0
"Such overviews are, however, rarely included in the relevant literature associated with extended lifetime studies.",0
"Methylation at CGIs is generally associated with transcriptional repression, although the local CpG density within a specific promoter can contribute to the actual transcriptional effect (Hackett & Surani2013; Messerschmidt et\xa0al.2014).",0
"Consequently, these studies are rarely considered acceptable to many regulatory authorities and are not specifically requested for ethical reasons, the numbers of animals needed to ensure appropriate statistical power would be both unworkable, and unethical.",0
"There are other more time and financially economical ways in which lifetime, multigenerational and/or transgenerational toxicity could be assessed, for example using zebrafish models, both respecting the 3Rs and satisfying sufficient statistical power.",0
"Already widely used in the pharmaceutical industry for developmental toxicity screening, zebrafish models appear to be a promising alternative to mice.",0
"Furthermore, it is also important to consider the broader repercussions of regulatory toxicology.",0
"Of course, it is vital that any environmental toxicant is carefully regulated or even banned from use.",0
"However, the situation is often not as straightforward as this.",0
"For example, chemicals can have far-reaching benefits to society, from agriculture to medicine and food/product safety to the development of new technologies.",0
Regulations are frequently a fine balance between maximizing the â€˜modern lifeâ€™ benefits of an environmental chemical while minimizing any potential adverse effects.,0
"This is where dose/level of exposure and relevance to humans is crucial, but considerations of alternative replacements are also important.",0
Do we run the risk of banning a chemical that does not demonstrate any epigenetic toxicity at the levels found within the environment or human populations only to replace it with an alternative whose characteristics and potential effects we know even less about?,0
"Surely, it is better for both society and public health to fully assess the potential epigenetic effects of environmental exposures and introduce regulations and TGs based on relevant data and proven mechanisms of toxicity.",0
"Conclusions\nDespite the fact that the seminal work on environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity was published over a decade ago, this area of research largely remains in its infancy, striving to elucidate putative mechanisms of epigenetic toxicity and identify mechanistic associations in human cohorts.",0
Much less is known about the mechanisms of DNA demethylation.,0
"This might well be expected since the fundamental idea that environmental factors can induce phenotypic changes across multiple generations challenges the central dogma of genetic inheritance, moving into what was a controversial area of genetics, but is now better accepted and established, Lamarckism.",0
It has long been suggested that 5mC can be removed by both passive (through lack of maintenance during replication) and active (enzymatic) mechanisms.,0
"While many hundreds of studies have investigated environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity, relatively few (47 to-date) have demonstrated a mechanistic association among specific environmental exposures, epigenetic changes and adverse phenotypes.",0
"Even fewer (18 of the 47 to-date) further established causality, all of which were studies in rodent models.",0
"Moreover, the majority of these 47 studies represent exploratory in vivo high (often single) dose range experiments, many orders of magnitude above likely human exposures.",0
"Nevertheless, they do set a precedent for the existence of environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity, and provide tools for linking environmental exposures to adverse health outcomes.",0
"Thus, although the current literature remains incomplete regarding specific mechanisms of epigenetically mediated environmentally induced toxicity in humans at doses relevant to human exposures, there is sufficient information to perform retrospective epigenetic analysis of existing regulatory studies and identify future research needs.",0
"For example, epigenetic mechanisms and markers identified within the 47 studies highlighted in this review could be further examined and potentially validated in existing regulatory studies.",0
"Improved human exposure data could be collected and used to facilitate the use of more relevant doses, routes of administration, metabolites and mixtures.",0
"Guidelines could be developed for improved molecular ( in vivo , in vitro and epidemiological) and bioinformatic study designs that incorporate suitable new technologies (such as omics platforms) and appropriate inhibitors/treatments/cessations (for exposure/change/effect validation) to definitively identify detailed epigenetic mechanisms that link, or act as markers of, environmental exposures and adverse health outcomes.",0
"Yet, specific DNA demethylase enzyme(s) in mammals remained elusive until the discovery of the 10â€“11 translocation (TET) enzyme family.",0
"Collaboration between scientists from academia, industry, and governmental and regulatory bodies will promote further research within a regulatory context, and drive the development and implementation of epigenetically relevant integrated testing strategies or policies for the continued protection of public health.",0
"This family, which can oxidize 5mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and further to 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxycytosine (5caC) (Tahiliani et\xa0al.2009; Ito et\xa0al.2011), has fueled research into indirect active DNA demethylation pathways.",0
"Consequently, a range of mechanisms for the demethylation of DNA have been proposed (described in relation to mammalian development in Dean2014; Messerschmidt et\xa0al.2014; Messerschmidt,2016).",0
It was widely believed that these 20â€“30\u2009000 protein-coding genes were the sole mediators and executors of all cellular functions.,0
The remaining 95â€“99% of the genome was regarded as â€˜junkâ€™ DNA.,0
"However, a functional role for ncDNA was inferred from the strong correlation between increasing ncDNA abundance and increasing organism complexity (Mattick2007).",0
"Indeed, over the last decade, the previous gene-centric dogma, central to molecular biology, has been shown to be incorrect.",0
"[""All these mechanisms play critical roles throughout normal mammalian development, particularly during early embryo and germ cell development (Cook & Blelloch2013; Beaujean2014; Dean2014; Hale et\xa0al.2014; Luk et\xa0al.2014; Messerschmidt et\xa0al.2014; Mukherjee et\xa0al.2014; O'Doherty & McGettigan2014; Grote & Herrmann2015; Hogg & Western2015; Marcho et\xa0al.2015).""]",0
"As with any rapidly developing field, there is a continuous generation of new information that must be incorporated as appropriate, such as novel histone or DNA modifications and ncRNAs families implicated in the epigenetic regulation of the mammalian life cycle (Dean2014; Hale et\xa0al.2014; Messerschmidt et\xa0al.2014; Sun et\xa0al.2014; Garcia-Lopez et\xa0al.2015; Sharma et\xa0al.2016); and new functions for existing epigenetic mechanisms within mammalian development (Gou et\xa0al.2014; Kuramochi-Miyagawa et\xa0al.2008; Watanabe et\xa0al.2008,2011; Li et\xa0al.2015, Pantano et\xa0al.2015; Williams et\xa0al.2015; Zhang et\xa0al.2015).",0
"Such epigenetic processes can be perturbed by environmental factors, potentially leading to an adverse phenotypic outcome.",0
"It is worth noting that some genomic regions escape this first global â€˜resetâ€™, including imprinted control regions (ICRs) and the most active TEs.",0
"The placenta and brain, in particular, express many of the imprinted genes, in keeping with experimentally identified roles for imprinted genes in prenatal nutrient acquisition and growth regulation, neurodevelopment, and postnatal energy homeostasis and behavior.",0
"It is, therefore, vital for normal embryo development that these imprints are maintained during the first global epigenetic re-programing event.",0
"Similarly, the activation of TEs would be deleterious for the embryonic genome and so the continued silencing of such loci through early embryogenesis is essential for genome stability and subsequent normal development.",0
It is essential for the generation of subsequent germ cells (and thus the successful production of future generations) that parental imprints within PGCs are removed and new imprints are re-established according to the gender of the embryo.,0
The mechanisms protecting specific genomic regions from epigenetic re-programing are not yet well-understood.,0
"However, some recent insights are presented and discussed in Hatanaka et\xa0al.",0
"Thus, a similar sncRNA switch, this time back to increased genome protection makes functional sense.",0
"Finally, it is important to note that histone modifications, DNA methylation and ncRNAs are not separate processes; they are closely linked throughout mammalian development.",0
"Thus, all the machinery involved in these pathways, including DNA and RNA binding and modifying proteins, are epigenetically important.",0
"Many hundreds of studies have investigated such toxicity, yet relatively few have demonstrated a mechanistic association among specific environmental exposures, epigenetic changes and adverse health outcomes in human epidemiological cohorts and/or rodent models.",0
"While such complex networks exist to maintain cellular homeostasis, they are open to environmental perturbation (Figure 1).",0
"Indeed, numerous environmental factors have been shown to induce epigenetic changes via a variety of mechanisms.",0
"These include both direct and indirect processes that ultimately lead to alterations in DNA methylation, histone modification and/or ncRNA expression.",0
Both chemically induced DNA adducts and those generated as a consequence of reactive oxygen species damage resulting from chemical exposure can interfere with the ability of epigenetic machinery to interact with DNA (Baccarelli & Bollati2009; Ruiz-Hernandez et\xa0al.2015).,0
"Reactive oxygen species are also proposed to stimulate the production of alpha-ketoglutarate, a co-substrate for TETs and one of the two main classes of histone demethylases (Chervona & Costa2012; Ruiz-Hernandez et\xa0al.2015).",0
Additional epigenetic mechanisms are likely to be elucidated as research continues.,0
"It is when these environmentally induced perturbations exceed the capacity of the cell to maintain homeostasis that epigenetic toxicity occurs, potentially leading to altered phenotypes and adversely impacting public health.",0
"Even in adulthood the same epigenetic processes drive cell proliferation, differentiation, function and adaptation.",0
"Environmentally induced epigenetic changes later in life can, therefore, also influence an individualâ€™s health.",0
"Indeed, numerous adult onset diseases have been associated with abnormal epigenetic changes, including cancer, diabetes, and neurological, renal, cardiac and respiratory conditions (Hamm & Costa2015); and epigenetic processes play a key role in initiating the onset of puberty, changes to which can also increase the risk of some of these adult onset diseases (Rzeczkowska et\xa0al.2014).",0
"However, certain stages in development and cell types can be thought of as particularly sensitive to epigenetic change due to the resulting severity of the outcome for the individual or the potential for affecting multiple generations.",0
"Such changes could have far-reaching consequences on embryo viability and development (including early germ line formation), and thus subsequent future health and fertility.",0
"This concept of phenotypic plasticity, particularly as a consequence of different environments in early life, implicates epigenetic mechanisms and has fueled research into environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity.",0
"However, as stated above, all 10 of the studies shown inTable 1further confirmed identified associations between environmental exposures, specific epigenetic changes and adverse phenotypes in a relevant in vivo and/or in vitro system; and seven of the 10 studies either directly sampled the target tissue or validated the same change in the blood and target tissue of an appropriate in vivo model.",0
"While the remaining studies do not necessarily demonstrate causality, they do provide additional mechanistic associations between exposure (again largely high dose) to BPA, formaldehyde, nickel, phthalates, TCDD, alcohol, undernutrition, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenyl-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), peanut, cigarette smoke, nicotine or NKK, epigenetic changes and adverse phenotypes.",0
"Other exposures of environmental origin that have been extensively investigated in both human cohorts and rodent models include stress, recreational drugs, maternal immune activation/infection and parental age.",0
"These studies do not necessarily rule out an epigenetic mechanism of toxicity per se , but they do exclude a link between the specific epigenetic, exposure and/or adverse endpoints/markers investigated.",0
Priority questions: What are the detailed mechanism(s) that link a particular exposure to a specific adverse effect?,0
Early life\nEarly embryo and germ line development can be affected by in utero exposures.,0
Environmentally induced epigenetic changes during the vital first developmental re-programing and programing event could result in incorrect erasure and/or re-establishment of the embryo epigenome.,0
"This could lead to activation of TEs, and abnormal imprinting and gene expression.",0
"It is also important to consider, however, early ex utero exposures.",0
"Early childhood and adolescence are also periods of significant growth and development, so it is easy to envisage how environmentally induced epigenetic changes during these stages could have detrimental effects on future health and fertility.",0
"Gametogenesis and pre-conception\nSpermatogenesis occurs continuously in adult males and even though females are born with their full complement of oocytes, oocyte maturation occurs in a continuous cycle throughout the reproductive life of adult females.",0
"Thus, environmental exposures to those oocytes and spermatozoa that go onto produce an embryo (pre-conception exposures) are also an important consideration.",0
"While this small body of evidence is largely composed of exploratory in vivo high-dose range studies, it does set a precedent for the existence of environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity.",0
"Environmentally induced epigenetic changes in the sperm or egg prior to conception could, therefore, affect embryo viability and development and the subsequent future health and fertility of the next generation.",0
"Indeed, murine spermatozoal miRNAs and/or esiRNAs have been shown to function in fertilization and early embryo development (Liu et\xa0al.2012,2016; Yuan et\xa0al.2016), and to influence phenotypic outcomes in subsequent progeny (Rassoulzadegan et\xa0al.2006; Wagner et\xa0al.2008; Grandjean et\xa0al.2009).",0
"Moreover, subsequent studies have further demonstrated that early life trauma or parental stress can induce altered miRNA expression in sperm, which in turn can transmit behavioral and metabolic abnormalities through to the next murine generation (Rodgers et\xa0al.2013; Gapp et\xa0al.2014; Rodgers et\xa0al.2015).",0
"It is also worth noting that some of these RNA-mediated phenotypes have been shown to be dependent upon the remaining member of the DNMT family, DNMT2 (Kiani et\xa0al.2013).",0
"Although DNMT2 has demonstrated some weak DNMT activity, it is predominantly associated with RNA, particularly tRNA, methylation, potentially contributing to the regulation of RNA stability and translation (Motorin et\xa0al.2010).",0
"Somatic versus germ cell change\nIf an epigenetic change occurs in a somatic cell or in a germ cell that is correctly â€˜resetâ€™ during germ line development in the subsequent offspring, then only one generation will be affected.",0
"However, if an epigenetic change becomes permanently established in the germ line, it will be transmitted across future generations, even in the absence of the original stimulus.",0
"Recent data has extended this list to include specific regions not associated with TEs that are preferentially located within CGIs, enhancers, promoters and gene bodies (Seisenberger et\xa0al.2012; Hackett et\xa0al.2013; Tang et\xa0al.2015).",0
"These both provide evidence that DNA methylation can be stably inherited, and highlight specific loci protected from global epigenetic erasure that could be involved in transmitting epigenetic information across generations.",0
"These retained histones are not randomly distributed throughout the male genome, they are particularly enriched at the promoters of developmental genes.",0
"Thus, spermatozoal chromatin may also transmit unique epigenetic information that helps to activate and regulate early embryo development and contribute to epigenetic inheritance across multiple generations.",0
"Consequently, there is worldwide recognition of this phenomenon, and discussion on how to both guide further scientific research towards a greater mechanistic understanding of environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity in humans, and translate relevant research outcomes into appropriate regulatory policies for effective public health protection.",0
This so-called transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is a hotly debated topic.,0
Much of the controversy is concerned with multigenerational versus transgenerational epigenetic toxicity (or epigenetic effect(s) versus epigenetic inheritance) (Figure 3).,0
"If an environmental exposure is truly transgenerational, then: (1) following an in utero exposure the resulting change penetrates to at least the F3generation (great-great grandchildren), where F0is the exposed mother and F3represents the first non-exposed generation; or (2) following an ex utero exposure in childhood/adulthood the resulting change penetrates to at least the F2generation (the great-grandchildren), where F0is the exposed generation and F2represents the first non-exposed generation.",0
A transgenerational change thus represents epigenetic inheritance.,0
"Conversely, a multigenerational change represents an epigenetic effect that affects multiple generations, all of which were exposed to the original stimulus, either directly as the exposed mother or child/adult or indirectly as an embryo or PGC within the exposed generation.",0
"With respect to public health, however, this is mere semantics; both could have far-reaching consequences for the present and future health of human populations.",0
Identifying and understanding environmentally induced epigenetic change(s) that may lead to adverse outcomes is vital for protecting public health.,0
It is not necessarily important whether an environmental exposure induces adverse outcomes in multiple exposed or non-exposed generations.,0
The fact that it may cause epigenetic toxicity in any generation makes it relevant to public health.,0
"Penetration of adverse effect(s) to the first non-exposed generation (the F3generation following in utero exposure, or the F2generation following ex utero exposure) represents true epigenetic inheritance and thus transgenerational toxicity.",0
"Adverse effect(s) that affect multiple generations, all of which were exposed either directly or indirectly to the original factor represent epigenetic effect(s) and thus multigenerational toxicity.",0
"Current evidence for putative environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity\n\nHuman cohorts\nFor many decades, there have been epidemiological studies linking the risks of adverse phenotypes to a wide range of environmental factors.",0
Introduction\nThe belief that the sequence of our DNA (our genome) is the sole determinant of our life-long development and health has long been regarded as too simplistic.,0
"For example, pre-conception, in utero or childhood undernutrition have been associated with an increased risk of developing various adult-onset diseases, including psychiatric disorders, type 2 diabetes and obesity, in numerous famine cohorts such as the Dutch Hunger Winter, the Chinese Great Leap Forward and the Ã–verkalix cohorts (Lumey et\xa0al.2011; Pembrey et\xa0al.2014).",0
"Likewise, metabolic syndromes, hormonal perturbation, reduced sperm quality and increased cancer risks have been associated with chemical and radiation exposures in the survivors of human disasters, including the Seveso dioxin release, the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs and the Chernobyl nuclear accident (Warner et\xa0al.2011,2013; Foley et\xa0al.2015; Kamiya et\xa0al.2015).",0
"In addition, large human cohorts that have recruited participants at birth for long-term follow up with comprehensive data and sample collection, such as the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort (Boyd et\xa0al.2013), provide a wealth of information to investigate epidemiological links between specific environmental exposures and public health outcomes.",0
"There have been over 1200 publications using data from ALSPAC (ALSPAC 2016), many of which have linked pre-conception and in utero environmental factors (including chemicals, pharmaceuticals, nutrition, smoking, anxiety and depression) with adverse outcomes (such as asthma and other respiratory disorders, increased weight/BMI-related issues and behavioral problems) (Golding2010; Boyd et\xa0al.2013).",0
"In particular, studies examining the parental and grandparental smoking status have demonstrated an interesting gender-specific association between paternal pre-conception or grandmaternal in utero exposure to cigarette smoke and increased weight-related issues in the subsequent sons and grandsons, but not daughters or granddaughters (Pembrey et\xa0al.2014).",0
"Gender-specific effects were also observed in a number of the famine cohorts, with an increased risk of obesity occurring in female descendants only (Lumey et\xa0al.2011; Pembrey et\xa0al.2014).",0
"The association of later life health with pre-conception, in utero or childhood environmental factors has led to the â€œDevelopmental Origins of Health and Diseaseâ€ (DOHaD) hypothesis (Wadhwa et\xa0al.2009).",0
"The DOHaD hypothesis evolved from Barkerâ€™s â€œthrifty phenotypeâ€ hypothesis originally proposed over 25 years ago (reviewed in Barker2007), and was formed â€œto recogniseâ€¦.the concept that the early life environment has widespread consequences for later healthâ€ (Wadhwa et\xa0al.2009).",0
We therefore sought to review the existing literature (up to 7 March 2016) to evaluate the current evidence for such toxicity.,0
"These studies can be ranked into categories that demonstrate (1) associations between environmental exposure(s), global epigenetic change(s) and adverse phenotype(s); (2) associations between environmental exposure(s), specific epigenetic changes(s) and adverse phenotypes(s) (including further subcategories, such as size and nature of cohort, type of sample analyzed, use of case controls, dose- and/or time-dependent changes, single changes within relevant biological pathways, multiple changes within the same biological pathway, correlation of changes with gene expression at mRNA and/or protein level, use of additional mechanistically relevant controls, robust statistical analysis, validation in independent cohorts); or (3) associations between environmental exposure(s), specific epigenetic changes(s) and adverse phenotypes(s) that were confirmed in a relevant in vivo and/or in vitro system.",0
"Darwinâ€™s â€˜On the Origin of the Speciesâ€™ highlighted the role of the environment in the process of evolution, the natural selection of advantageous genetic mutations through environmental pressures (Darwin1859).",0
Studies falling into category 3 provide more comprehensive mechanistic evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity and are shown inTable 1.,0
"Specifically, these studies provide mechanistic associations between bisphenol A (BPA), formaldehyde, arsenic, nickel, or cigarette smoke, epigenetic changes and adverse phenotypes, and potential mechanisms of epigenetic toxicity in humans.",0
The smoking evidence is particularly compelling as it has been established by multiple independent groups investigating different epigenetic mechanisms.,0
"In addition, studies within categories 1 and 2 may also enable the identification of markers and/or mechanisms of environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity through a weight of evidence approach (e.g.",0
"the same association(s) reported in multiple independent cohorts or multiple association(s) that contribute to the same biological pathway), and are, therefore, included in Supplementary Table 2.",0
Current evidence for putative environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity in human epidemiological cohorts.,0
It has also been recognized that the pace of such change is sometimes too rapid to be accounted for by natural selection.,0
(2014)\nOnly studies that measured both adverse phenotypes and associated epigenetic changes in response to an environmental exposure were reviewed.,0
"All the studies shown here demonstrated associations among environmental exposure(s), specific epigenetic changes(s) and adverse phenotypes(s) that were confirmed in a relevant in vivo and/or in vitro system.",0
"Furthermore, while human epidemiological cohort studies can demonstrate association, they do not prove causality.",0
"They are also complicated by the fact that the biological material under study, often blood cells, is not from the target organ/tissue.",0
"Interpretation of the findings with respect to mechanistic connections between environmental factors, epigenetic changes and adverse effects in the target organ/tissue can therefore be challenging.",0
"As such, these studies are of greater mechanistic relevance, and provide more comprehensive evidence for putative causal relationships.",0
Rodent models\nThe deleterious effects of exposures to environmental factors in human cohorts have stimulated investigations of environmentally induced toxicity in rodent models.,0
"In the late 1990s/early 2000s, these studies began to associate adverse phenotypes resulting from environmental exposures with epigenetic mechanisms (Issa et\xa0al.1996; Tao et\xa0al.1998,1999; Choi et\xa0al.1999; Bielawski et\xa0al.2002; Govindarajan et\xa0al.2002; Chen et\xa0al.2004; Marwick et\xa0al.2004; Pulling et\xa0al.2004; Vuillemenot et\xa0al.2004; Wu et\xa0al.2004).",0
"Then in 2005, Anway et\xa0al.",0
"demonstrated that in utero exposure to the environmental chemical vinclozolin (a fungicide used in the wine industry) reduced sperm quantity, quality and thus male fertility with a >90% penetrance through multiple generations (to at least the F4generation).",0
"The effect appeared to be transmitted through the male germ line, with altered DNA methylation patterns detected in the testes of the F1generation and the sperm of the F2and F3generations.",0
This was the first study to show phenotypic and epigenetic changes in generations not directly exposed to the original stimulus.,0
"As expected, this study generated some controversy, particularly when subsequent groups failed to reproduce the same results (Gray & Furr2008; Schneider et\xa0al.2008; Inawaka et\xa0al.2009; Schneider et\xa0al.2013).",0
These disparities may have been due to the use of different routes of administration and variations in rat strains/stocks.,0
"First Lamarck, and then Waddington, suggested that alternative mechanisms, now termed epigenetics, must also contribute to phenotypic outcomes (Noble2006).",0
"Nevertheless, over the ensuing decade the hundreds of subsequent studies have provided more evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity.",0
"We identified 147 rodent studies within PubMed (up to 7 March 2016) demonstrating both adverse phenotype(s) (such as reduced fertility, reproductive, developmental or other organ-specific abnormalities, or adult onset diseases (cancer, diabetes, obesity or immune disorders)) and epigenetic change(s) (histone modification, DNA methylation, epigenetic machinery or miRNAs) following exposure to environmental factor(s) (including chemicals, radiation or lifestyle factors (alcohol, nutrition, or smoking)) at various stages of development (pre-conception, in utero , neonatal, lactation, childhood, adolescence and adulthood).",0
"These studies can be ranked into categories that demonstrate (1) environmentally induced adverse phenotype(s) and global epigenetic change(s); (2) environmentally induced adverse phenotype(s) and specific epigenetic change(s) (including further subcategories, such as dose- and/or time-dependent changes, single changes within relevant biological pathways, multiple changes within the same biological pathway, correlation of changes with gene expression at mRNA and/or protein level, use of additional mechanistically relevant controls, robust statistical analysis); (3) environmentally induced adverse phenotype(s) and specific epigenetic change(s) that were reversed by an inhibitor/treatment, absent in a knock out/down model, and/or mechanistically linked in a relevant in vitro system; or (4) the same environmentally induced adverse phenotype(s) and specific epigenetic change(s) in both rodent model(s) and human cohort(s).",0
Studies falling into categories 3 and/or 4 provide more comprehensive mechanistic evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity and are shown inTable 2.,0
"In total, 18 of the 40 studies shown inTable 2validated loss of both epigenetic change(s) and adverse effect(s) following appropriate inhibition, treatment or knock out/down; thereby demonstrating a definitive causal link between exposure (largely high dose) to BPA, formaldehyde, cadmium, methylmercury, 2,3,7,8-tetra-chloro-dibenzo- p -dioxin (TCDD), urethane, vinyl carbamate, alcohol, caffeine, overnutrition, cigarette smoke, nicotine or 4-(methyl-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), epigenetic changes and adverse phenotypes.",0
"The BPA, TCDD, alcohol and smoking-related evidence is particularly compelling as it has been established by multiple independent groups investigating different epigenetic mechanisms.",0
"In addition, studies within categories 1 and 2 may also enable identification of markers and/or mechanisms of environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity through a weight of evidence approach (e.g.",0
"the same epigenetic change(s) reported in multiple independent studies or multiple epigenetic changes that contribute to the same biological pathway), and, therefore, are included in Supplementary Table 3.",0
"While much of the work to date has focused on rodent models, there is also some evidence for environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity in other mammalian species, including sheep and monkeys (Wu et\xa0al.2008; Begum et\xa0al.2013; Lie et\xa0al.2014a,2014b).",0
Current evidence for putative environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity in rodent models.,0
"It is the complex interaction among our genome, epigenome and environment that shapes our development into unique individuals, and thus influences our health and potentially the health of our future offspring.",0
(2010)*/â€¡\nOnly studies assessing both adverse phenotypes and associated epigenetic changes in response to an environmental exposure were reviewed.,0
"*Studies demonstrating environmentally-induced adverse phenotype(s) and specific epigenetic change(s) that were reversed by an inhibitor/treatment, absent in a knock out/down model, and/or mechanistically linked in a relevant in vitro system.",0
"â€ Studies validating loss of both epigenetic change(s) and adverse effect(s) following appropriate inhibition, treatment or knock out/down.",0
â€¡Studies demonstrating the same environmentally induced adverse phenotype(s) and specific epigenetic change(s) in both animal model(s) and human cohort(s).,0
Â¶Studies in which environmentally induced adverse phenotype(s) and epigenetic change(s) were reported in separate publications but were performed within the same experimental animals.,0
"While this large body of work also provides some comprehensive evidence for, and specific mechanisms of, epigenetic toxicity, it was considered outside the scope of this review.",0
"Likewise, pharmaceutical drug-induced epigenetic toxicity in human cohorts and rodent models has also been reported.",0
"However, such drugs are not environmental factors and so were not considered any further.",0
"Moreover, there were additional studies that have investigated environmentally induced epigenetic changes without simultaneously assessing any phenotypic/toxicological endpoints and/or focused on acute exposures (less than 24\u2009h).",0
"While such studies are more difficult to interpret with respect to epigenetic toxicity (and so were not included in this review), they may still provide useful mechanistic data.",0
It is important to note that not all environmentally induced adverse phenotypes have been associated with epigenetic changes.,0
"Indeed, 18 human cohort and 20 rodent studies within PubMed reported a lack of epigenetically related toxicity (Supplementary Table 4).",0
"The induction of adverse DNA mutations by environmental factors that lead to disease, particularly cancer, is well established and recognized by regulatory bodies worldwide.",0
The literature also contains many in vitro studies investigating the role of specific epigenetic mechanisms in adverse outcomes induced by environmental exposures.,0
"In addition, concurrent in vivo and in vitro studies have improved our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the mammalian life cycle, including recent insights into early human development (Laird2013; Slieker et\xa0al.2015; Surani2015; Williams et\xa0al.2015), and epigenetic inheritance in simpler model systems such as Caenorhabditis elegans , Drosophilamelanogaster and Daniorerio (zebrafish) (Padilla et\xa0al.2014; Somer & Thummel2014; Williams et\xa0al.2014).",0
"Thus, although comparison and integration of these different human cohort, animal, and in vitro studies is complicated by the different doses, routes of administration, timings and lengths of exposures, the various strains, species, cell types or statistical methods used, and/or the specific adverse outcome(s) or marker(s) selected, the current evidence demonstrates a mechanistic association between specific environmental exposures, epigenetic changes and adverse health outcomes in human epidemiological cohorts and model systems.",0
More studies that incorporate some form of inhibition/treatment/cessation into the experimental design are vital for establishing whether or not an exposure truly represents an epigenetic toxicant.,0
"Although potentially complex, the use of a systems biology approach, incorporating genome-wide analysis at multiple levels (histone code, methylome, non-coding RNA expression, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome) would provide comprehensive analysis of epigenetic changes and associated phenotypic outcomes.",0
Subsequent identification of human relevant mechanisms of epigenetic toxicity can then be further validated as appropriate in smaller more focused studies.,0
The challenge now is to fully identify and investigate the specific functional epigenetic mechanisms and biological pathways relevant to humans so that the risk(s) of environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity to public health can be properly assessed and addressed.,0
Research considerations for public health\nThere is no doubt that humans are exposed to a range of environmental factors during everyday life.,0
"However, to determine whether, or not, environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity is a real concern for public health there are a number of important considerations.",0
Mechanisms and model systems\nThe nature of the research means that studies in humans are mainly restricted to epidemiological cohorts.,0
"There are, however, no current established regulatory procedures or guidelines in chemical safety programs for determining environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity.",0
These cohorts often have limited availability of appropriate biosample at appropriate collection windows (Bakulski & Fallin2014).,0
"Ex vivo or in vitro experiments on human embryonic tissue and cells are quite rightly restricted by ethics, and can only model a small part of the in vivo situation.",0
"Thus, the majority of whole system studies have been performed in animal models, predominantly rodents.",0
"While the rodent and human life cycles share many commonalities they do exhibit subtle differences, both with each other and other mammalian species (Kristensen et\xa0al.2013; Laird2013; Leitch et\xa0al.2013; Surani2015).",0
Such differences are of critical importance when considering mechanistic relevance to humans.,0
"Nevertheless, such work provides valuable data.",0
"The key is integrating and interpreting it correctly, in terms of differences/similarities at both the system ( in vitro versus in vivo ) and species (human versus non-human) levels.",0
"It is important to continue supplementing non-human models with human-derived data, incorporating new technologies to maximize data collection, and updating and re-evaluating current conclusions as novel information becomes available.",0
Do these mechanism(s) function in humans?,0
What are the potential human disease outcome(s)?,0
"We, therefore, wanted to examine both the potential public health concerns and the resulting regulatory implications of such toxicity.",0
"Dose, route, metabolism, timing and mixtures of exposure\nWhether, or not, an environmental exposure elicits a response depends on a range of interacting variables, including dose, route of administration, metabolism and additional/pre-existing exposures (mixtures).",0
"Much of the animal studies to date on environmental chemicals have involved administration of high doses, many orders of magnitude above likely exposures in real human populations.",0
"Similarly, the first animal study to demonstrate that an in utero exposure could induce adverse phenotypes in subsequent generations administered the environmental chemical vinclozolin via the intraperitoneal route (Anway et\xa0al.2005).",0
"Not only is it unlikely that a human would receive this, or any, environmental exposure via the same route of administration, but also the way in which an exposure is administered determines its overall effect.",0
"Indeed, oral administration of vinclozolin to pregnant females (the likely route of administration for humans given that vinclozolin is a fungicide used in the wine industry) failed to induce any adverse phenotypes in subsequent generations (Schneider et\xa0al.2008).",0
"Thus, while it is important to fully characterize the hazard, further studies at doses and routes of administration similar to those found in humans are necessary for determining relevance to public health.",0
"It is worth noting, however, that establishing the actual level of human exposure to a particular factor and mimicking it in experimental models is not always easy.",0
Metabolism is another major factor that can determine the overall effect of an environmental exposure.,0
"Thus, metabolism of the parent environmental compound can vary greatly between models, resulting in the production of different types and levels of metabolites.",0
"It is, therefore, important to assess if the model system being used accurately replicates the in vivo human metabolic environment, and if not to conduct further studies using any additional appropriate metabolites.",0
The timing of an environmental exposure can also be a major contributing factor to the significance of the overall outcome.,0
"As discussed earlier, some life stages may be more susceptible than others to a particular exposure.",0
There was the assumption that in utero exposure represents the most vulnerable period in an individualâ€™s life with respect to their future development.,0
"However, it is now becoming clear that pre-conception and postnatal exposures can also be detrimental to future health across multiple generations.",0
Multiple exposures at multiple life stages could be additive and/or cumulative.,0
"While a particular low-level exposure may have no adverse effects, multiple low-level exposures over multiple stages of life may induce adverse phenotypes.",0
"Thus, once individual exposures have been characterized, it may also be relevant to assess the effect of (1) mixtures of environmental exposures, (2) multiple lifetime exposures of single environmental exposures, and (3) multiple lifetime exposures of mixtures of environmental exposures.",0
"Priority questions : What dose(s) via what route(s) of administration are human populations actually exposed to, and what metabolite(s) are formed?",0
Do low-level exposures induce epigenetic toxicity?,0
Is any part of the life cycle particularly more sensitive to an exposure than others?,0
Are multiple exposures additive and/or cumulative?,0
Human variability\nIt is known that different strains of laboratory animals can respond very differently to the same environmental exposure.,0
Such differences are largely driven by diverse genetic backgrounds.,0
"Individual humans demonstrate substantial genetic differences and so an individualâ€™s underlying genetics could have a huge effect on his/her susceptibility to a particular environmental exposure, depending on his/her metabolism, adaptability, gender, age, previous exposures, etc.",0
"Thus, not all humans will respond to an environmental exposure in the same way.",0
"Indeed, there are many examples in the literature of how single polymorphisms (SNPs) can affect the response of individuals and populations to different environmental exposures.",0
These include not only mutations that alter the function of gene products but also those that lead to changes in DNA methylation or miRNA binding sites.,0
Priority question : How can we identify particularly susceptible individuals or populations?,0
"Recurrent acral angioosteoma cutis in a pregnant patient\n\nIntroduction\nGooge et\xa0al in 2006 first described 11 cases of acral angioosteoma cutis (AAOC), characterized by benign vascular and osseous lesions on acral skin.1Since then, there have been only 3 additional cases reported.2,3,4This friable erythematous exophytic papule has clinical resemblance to pyogenic granuloma (PG) but has distinct histologic features.",0
"Therefore, it is crucial for dermatologists to be aware of this condition, as it is rare and likely often misdiagnosed.",0
"To our knowledge, this case is the first report of AAOC in pregnancy.",0
"In addition to clinical similarity, AAOC could be misdiagnosed as PG with ossification because of the vascular and bony growth on histology.",0
"Of 4 reports of PG with ossification, only one commented on the lobular vascularity.5,6,7,8Kim et\xa0al5describes PG with ossification as lobular proliferation of capillaries with spicules of spongy bone with osteocytelike and osteoblastlike cells.",0
The pathogenesis of AAOC remains unclear.,0
Burgdorf and Nasemann6proposed 2 theories of cutaneous ossification.,0
One notion is that primitive mesenchymal cells differentiate into normal osteoblasts in the wrong location.,0
The other theory is that undifferentiated mesenchymal cells undergo metaplastic differentiation in the setting of inflammation or hypoxia.,0
"In previous case reports, the investigators believed that the vascular proliferation in both\xa0AAOC and PG were induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).2,3,4Endothelial cells produce signals such as bone morphogenic protein (BMP) to induce metaplastic differentiation and ectopic bone formation.9Osteoblasts are also\xa0responsible for production of VEGF.10The combination of VEGF and hypoxia induce BMP expression.9Together, VEGF and BMP are the most likely factors that induce vascular proliferation and bone formation in AAOC.",0
"Because AAOC might be misdiagnosed as PG or other benign cutaneous neoplasm, it may not be rare\xa0but rather underreported.",0
"With the possible driving factors of VEGF and BMP, this lesion is benign and can recur after excision.",0
Dermatologists should be aware of the distinguishing features of\xa0scattered bone formation and diffuse capillary proliferation of AAOC rather than the lobular aggregates in PG.,0
Long-Term Effects of Prenatal Exposure to Undernutrition on Cannabinoid Receptor-Related Behaviors: Sex and Tissue-Specific Alterations in the mRNA Expression of Cannabinoid Receptors and Lipid Metabolic Regulators\n\nAbstract\nMaternal malnutrition causes long-lasting alterations in feeding behavior and energy homeostasis in offspring.,0
"We investigated the long-term effects of maternal exposure to a 20% standard diet restriction during preconceptional and gestational periods on the metabolically-relevant tissues hypothalamus, liver, and perirenal fat (PAT) of male and female offspring at adulthood.",0
"Taking together, these data suggest that the ECS could play a putative role in nutritional programming and hence in the early origin of metabolic diseases.",0
"Regarding the potential relation between ECS and fetal undernutrition, a few studies have demonstrated that the maternal exposure to a calorie-restricted diet during pregnancy and/or lactation could decrease the hypothalamic endocannabinoids and/or acylethanolamines in offspring (Matias et al.,2003; RamÃ­rez-LÃ³pez et al.,2016).",0
"However, it is unknown whether changes in nutritional programming by maternal diet restriction during fetal development could modify the expression of ECS components later in life and lead to long-lasting impact on energy metabolism and feeding behavior.",0
"Based on these considerations, we aim to focus on the long-term effects on cannabinoid-related behaviors (i.e., cannabinoid receptor antagonist-induced suppression of feeding), and effects on lipid-related metabolic pathways of a maternal exposure to a moderate caloric restriction during the preconceptional and gestational period.",0
"Additionally, it was assessed the spontaneous and compulsive feeding behavior, growing parameters, leptin, plasma metabolites, and adiposity after weaning (adolescence and adulthood).",0
We hypothesize that the maternal exposure to a moderate calorie-restricted diet could alter the energy homeostasis regulated by the ECS and could re-program fatty-acid metabolism later in life in a sex-specific manner.,0
We also proposed that these putative alterations could increase the vulnerability to develop metabolic diseases in adulthood.,0
"In order to minimize the estrous cycle-related variability, the female rats were closely housed in adjacent cages and randomly distributed among the different experimental groups (McClintock,1978,1984).",0
"To avoid litter effects, samples from 6 to 15 liters per perinatal group were used in all determinations.",0
Statistical analysis indicated a significant decrease in body weight gain and caloric intake in the calorie-restricted dams after gestation.,0
"In contrast, calorie-restricted dams exhibited an increase in body weight gain after lactation, despite of the lack of effect on caloric intake during this period.",0
"From birth to PND 22 (lactation), three-way repeated measures ANOVA showed a main and significant effect of time on body weight [ F(22, 145)= 675.53, P< 0.001; Figure2B].",0
"No effects of diet and sex were detected, but interaction between time and diet was significant [ F(22, 145)= 11.27, P< 0.001].",0
"Particularly, Bonferroni analysis indicated that RC male offspring were born normoweight but displayed higher body weight than CC male offspring in several days of the lactation period (PND 1â€“2 and PND 9â€“11).",0
"Our results suggest that the long-lasting adaptive responses to maternal caloric restriction affected cannabinoid-regulated mechanisms involved in feeding behavior, adipose Î²-oxidation, and hepatic lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis in a sex-dependent manner.",0
We only found a difference between RC and CC female offspring at PND 20.,0
"However, no differences in body weight were found between CC males and CC females (Figure2B).",0
"Regarding the body weight during the post-weaning period (Figure2C), three-way ANOVA detected a main effect of time [ F(16, 58)= 689.326, P< 0.001] and sex [ F(1, 73)= 436.92, P< 0.001].",0
"Interaction between time and diet, time and sex, and time, diet, and sex were also significant [ F(16, 58)= 1.83, P< 0.05; F(16, 58)= 72.72, P< 0.001; F(16, 58)= 2.72, P< 0.01, respectively].",0
"Specifically, Bonferroni analysis indicated that RC males also displayed higher body weight than CC males in several weeks of the post-weaning period that comprise the adulthood (postnatal weeks 15â€“18 and postnatal week 19).",0
"However, no differences in body weight between CC and RC females were found.",0
"Concerning to cumulative caloric intake relative to body weight during the post-weaning period (Figure2D), we found a main effect of time [ F(15, 59)= 1712.38, P< 0.001] and sex [ F(1, 73)= 30.20, P< 0.001].",0
"Additionally, we detected interaction between time and diet [ F(15, 59)= 2.19, P< 0.05], time, and sex [ F(15, 59)= 13.28, P< 0.001] and time, diet, and sex [ F(15, 59)= 1.92, P< 0.05].",0
"Particularly, Bonferroni analysis indicated that RC males and RC females did not displayed higher caloric intake compared to the respective CC males and CC females.",0
"Regarding chocolate preference in adolescence (Figure3A), three-way ANOVA showed a main effect of time [ F(3, 65)= 474.01, P< 0.001], diet [ F(1, 67)= 7.49, P< 0.01], and sex [ F(1, 67)= 37.81, P< 0.001].",0
"The pressure to thinness in western societies associated to a higher prevalence of women with a past of eating disorders or a worry in excess about body changing during pregnancy and postpartum have raised the risk for giving birth underweight babies (Easter et al.,2013; Linna et al.,2014).",0
"Consequently, the exposure to a moderate or severe restricted diet during pregnancy has been associated to features of metabolic syndrome in adult offspring such as higher adiposity (Yura et al.,2005; Suzuki et al.,2010; Lukaszewski et al.,2011), alterations in glucose metabolism (Jimenez-Chillaron et al.,2005; Breton et al.,2009; Theys et al.,2011), or alterations in the lipid plasmatic profile (Desai et al.,2005,2007a; Palou et al.,2010,2012).",0
"Moreover, these metabolic alterations after a maternal calorie restricted diet have been found associated to abnormalities in feeding behavior such as hyperphagia (Vickers et al.,2000; Breton et al.,2009; Manuel-Apolinar et al.,2014) or high preference for high-fat diet (Palou et al.,2010; Lukaszewski et al.,2011).",0
Bonferrroni analysis showed that CC males treated with AM251 exhibited a lower chocolate intake than vehicle-treated CC males.,0
"Concerning the potential explanations of the differential phenotypic features between males and females, the leptin sensibility can play an important role.",0
"Indeed, the higher leptin levels in plasma without reduction in food intake suggest leptin resistance and, therefore, an altered leptin signaling (Friedman and Halaas,1998).",0
One possibility that emerges from our data is that male offspring can increase their body weight by either a reduction of energy expenditure or higher metabolism efficiency.,0
"This fact might be a consequence of the inadequate fetal programming of metabolic systems involved in energy homeostasis (Hales and Barker,2001; Vaag et al.,2012).",0
"The effect observed in the RC offspring were contrary to those from previous studies, which described either, an increased preference for higher caloric diets after exposure to caloric restriction during pregnancy (Lussana et al.,2008; Palou et al.,2010) or hyperphagia in animals fed with a high-fat diet (Lukaszewski et al.,2011).",0
Any explanation for these dimorphisms should be supported by the elevated gene expression of Cnr2 in the liver and PAT of the RC female offspring compared to those of the RC males.,0
A major issue in sex differences is the need for control the estrous phase on which the evaluations were performed in order to clarify the impact of sex hormones variations in the female.,0
"Since the number of animals needed to control the three phases of the estrous cycle, including morning to afternoon time variations, was too high to be affordable, we had to use randomly cycling female animals sacrificed only during the morning time.",0
"However, it is important to note that in the female rat, sex steroids regulate both the expression and function of the endogenous cannabinoid system, so a potential explanation will also involve the impact of malnutrition on this important modulatory system, as it was described previously (Bonnin et al.,1993; RodrÃ­guez de Fonseca et al.,1994).",0
"Moreover, the outcomes of the present study enhance the importance of the periconceptional period as well as the role of maternal diet in the early life programming, due to the fact that the maternal undernutrition was implemented before mating and offspring were raised in an ad libitum standard feeding.",0
"We also detected interaction between time and sex [ F(3, 65)= 13.55, P< 0.001].",0
Bonferroni analysis showed that RC adolescent females exhibited a decrease in chocolate preference at the second day of the test.,0
"At adulthood (Figure3B), we found a main effect of time [ F(3, 71)= 462.90, P< 0.001] and sex [ F(1, 73)= 13.99, P< 0.001] on chocolate preference.",0
"We also detected interaction between time and diet [ F(3, 71)= 3.64; P< 0.05], and time and sex [ F(3, 71)= 2.954, P< 0.05].",0
"Bonferrroni analysis indicated that CC and RC adult females displayed higher chocolate preference than the respective CC and RC adult males (days 1, 2, and 4).",0
"However, no differences in chocolate preference were found between CC and RC offspring at adulthood (Figure3B).",0
"Introduction\nAlthough, overnutrition is an important life style factor for the development of metabolic syndrome, obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus (Alberti et al.,2009), maternal undernutrition resulting in early life nutritional unbalance can be also related to the onset of long-term metabolic alterations observed later in life.",0
"Concerning to total caloric intake relative to body weight in adolescence (Figure3C), we detected a main effect of time [ F(3, 65)= 272.872; P< 0.001], sex [ F(1, 67)= 25.663; P< 0.001], and interaction between time and sex [ F(3, 65)= 22.908; P< 0.001].",0
"Specifically, Bonferroni analysis indicated that CC and RC adolescent females displayed higher caloric intake than the respective CC and RC adolescent males (days 1, 2, and/or 4).",0
No differences in the caloric intake were found between CC and RC offspring at adolescence (Figure3C).,0
"At adulthood (Figure3D), we observed a main effect of time [ F(3, 71)= 367.04, P< 0.001], diet [ F(1, 73)= 6.49, P< 0.05], and sex [ F(1, 73)= 124.57, P< 0.01].",0
"Interactions between time and sex [ F(3, 71)= 34.005, P< 0.01], and diet and sex [ F(1, 73)= 4.58, P< 0.05] were found.",0
"Specifically, Bonferroni analysis indicated that RC adult females exhibited a reduction in caloric intake compared to CC adult females at days 1 and 2 of the test.",0
"Regarding male offspring, two-way ANOVA indicated that there was not prenatal diet effect on chocolate intake and total caloric intake in a treatment-independent manner.",0
"However, we detected a main effect of treatment on chocolate intake [ F(3, 30)= 9.917, P< 0.01] and total caloric intake [ F(3, 30)= 11.189, P< 0.01].",0
"In contrast, both CC and RC males treated with AM251 showed a decrease in the total caloric intake (Figure3F).",0
"Regarding female offspring, two-way ANOVA indicated a main effect of prenatal diet [ F(3, 31)= 7.517, P< 0.05] and an almost significant effect of treatment [ F(3, 31)= 3.928, P = 0.056] on chocolate intake (Figure3G).",0
"Similarly, we detected a main effect of prenatal diet [ F(3, 31)= 12.458, P< 0.01] and an almost significant effect of treatment [ F(3, 31)= 3.853, P = 0.059] on total caloric intake (Figure3H).",0
"Long-term effect of prenatal caloric restriction on plasma levels of leptin, metabolites, alkaline phosphatase, and hepatic transaminases in adult offspring\nTwo-way ANOVA showed an effect of prenatal diet on the plasma levels of glucose, the lipid profile (triglycerides, HDL, LDL, and VLDL) and urea (Table1).",0
"In addition, a significant effect of sex on the plasma levels of total cholesterol, HDL, ALKP, and AST/ALT ratio was also observed.",0
"Interaction between diet and sex was found in the plasma levels of bilirubin and ALT (Table1), and an almost significant interaction in leptin levels [ F(1, 18)= 3.349, P = 0.084].",0
"Bonferroni analysis indicated that the RC males showed a significant increase in the plasma levels of leptin, triglycerides, VLDL, and bilirubin compared to the plasma of CC males.",0
"Importantly, this hypothesis supports that fetal undernutrition can represent the origin of cardiovascular disease, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia at adulthood (Barker and Osmond,1988; Barker et al.,1989,1993).",0

"Regarding the differences between male and female offspring, CC females showed an increase in the gene expression of Ppar Î± in liver, but a decrease in the gene expression of Ppar Î³ in PAT (Figures6A,B).",0
"Discussion\nThis study demonstrates that the maternal exposure to a moderate (20%) caloric restriction (undernutrition) during preconceptional (2 weeks) and gestational (up 2 days before birth) periods produced long-term effects on body weight, feeding behavior and gene expression of key components of the ECS (receptors and enzymes) in a sex-dependent manner.",0
"These effects extended to lipid and cholesterol metabolic pathways, suggesting the existence of a complex pattern alterations derived of adaptation to maternal malnutrition.",0
A moderate maternal caloric restriction produces sex-dimorphic effects in feeding and body weight gain only after weaning\nThe dams exposed to undernutrition during prenatal stages exhibited a reduction in their body weight gain and caloric intake during gestation that contrasts with the increase in their body weight during lactation with normal nutrition.,0
"This finding is in agreement with previous studies in humans, which demonstrated that offspring exposed to famine or hyperemesis gravidarum in the first part of pregnancy did not show lower birth weight (Roseboom et al.,2006; Grooten et al.,2015).",0
"Similarly, animal studies documented normoweight at birth when the early pregnancy was conducted under caloric restriction (Cleal et al.,2007; Palou et al.,2010; Poore et al.,2010).",0
"In contrast, a lower weight at birth has been described in several studies when the calorie-restricted diet was prolonged to birth (Desai et al.,2005; Lukaszewski et al.,2011).",0
"It is still unknown whether both, the endocannabinoid (eCB) machinery and the lipid metabolism are implicated in long-term adaptive responses to fetal reprogramming caused by maternal undernutrition.",0
"An explanation that emerges from these studies is that the putative fetal underweight caused by maternal undernutrition may be recovered in few days of normal nutrition, as was previously suggested (Cleal et al.,2007; RamÃ­rez-LÃ³pez et al.,2016).",0
"Returning to our data, weight recovery in offspring may occur as a result of an accelerated catch-up growth before birth caused by an ad libitum maternal feeding.",0
The differential response to the maternal undernutrition in energy balance is sexual dimorphism dependent during the post-weaning periods.,0
The results indicated that CC male rats showed an increase in body weight and abdominal fat mass that contrasted with a decrease in caloric intake and compulsive feeding during the adolescence and adulthood compared to CC female rats.,0
"However, we should not discard a predictive marker of impaired fetal nutrition in those cases with absence of low birth weight.",0
"As we will discuss below, these sex-differences extend to metabolic pathways under the control of the endogenous cannabinoid system, as previously suggested (Wagner,2016).",0
"Thus, the effects of the maternal caloric restriction on the energy balance of male and female offspring should be interpreted based on their sex-dependent basal metabolism.",0
"The increase in body weight of RC male offspring is directly associated with an increase in abdominal fat and, particularly, a higher percentage of perirenal adiposity relative to body weight.",0
"The elevated fat mass and body weight justify the higher levels of triglycerides, LDL, VLDL, bilirubin, and the adipocytes-specific satiety hormone leptin in plasma.",0
"In contrast, the female offspring from calorie-restricted dams did not show changes in body weight and adiposity, but exhibited higher levels of LDL and glucose in plasma, and a reduction in chocolate preference at adolescence and total caloric intake at adulthood.",0
"The lower compulsive feeding in RC females can be associated with the hyperglycemia via a hypothalamic impairment of glucose-sensing to control hunger and satiety (Routh et al.,2014).",0
Previous researches have demonstrated metabolic alterations after undernutrition in a sex-dependent manner.,0
"Increased adiposity, lipid profile, glycemia, and leptinemia in male offspring have been reported after the exposure to a moderate undernutrition at different pregnancy periods (Desai et al.,2007a; Palou et al.,2010).",0
"A putative decrease in hypothalamic sensitivity to leptin may result in an inability to detect satiety despite the fat stores, which finally develop to obesity (Sasaki,2015).",0
"The higher leptin sensitivity described in females than in males has been associated with gonadal hormones (Clegg et al.,2003,2006) and may explain in part the higher levels of leptin found in the plasma of male offspring.",0
"Furthermore, the placenta responses to maternal diet in a sex-specific manner (Tarrade et al.,2015), suggesting that the sexual dimorphism in adiposity-relevant parameters could be present at very early stages.",0
"Effects of moderate maternal caloric restriction on feeding behavior\nThis differential sex effect on body weight after maternal caloric restriction was in agreement with data from previous studies (Palou et al.,2010).",0
"The obvious explanations to the higher body weight found in RC males after weaning could be as a consequence of an increased food intake, decreased energy expenditure or higher metabolic efficiency.",0
"Concerning hyperphagia, several studies have reported this feeding alteration after the exposure to undernutrition in critical windows of development (Vickers et al.,2000; Desai et al.,2005; Breton et al.,2009; Palou et al.,2010; Lukaszewski et al.,2011; Manuel-Apolinar et al.,2014), so it has been proposed as an important contributor of the excessive body weight.",0
"Experiments with animals models have succeeded in simulate metabolic alterations of undernutrition during gestational periods in humans, particularly by the implementation of a moderate or severe calorie restricted diets (Desai et al.,2005; GarcÃ­a et al.,2010; Palou et al.,2010; Suzuki et al.,2010; Lukaszewski et al.,2011).",0
"Intriguingly, our data indicated that either male or female offspring from calorie-restricted dams did not display higher caloric intake after weaning, despite of the fact that the males exhibited greater body weight at adulthood.",0
"Indeed, discrepancies were also found in the literature.",0
"For instance, it has been also documented excessive body weight in absence of higher food intake (Yura et al.,2005; Sebert et al.,2009; Theys et al.,2011).",0
"Evidence in some studies pointed out that hyperphagia could be a transitory effect that disappears when the underweighted animals after maternal undernutrition were able to reach the weight as controls (Vickers et al.,2000; Lukaszewski et al.,2011).",0
"So, hyperphagia could be a compensatory effect after prolonged underweight.",0
"In this context, it is plausible in our experimental model that RC offspring did not showed underweight and, therefore, hyperphagia in any stage.",0
"It is important to note that when caloric intake is adjusted to body weight the effect of maternal caloric restriction on appetite seems more discrete (Lagisz et al.,2014).",0
"The analysis of the cannabinoid-regulated metabolism, such as the expression of key enzymes, receptors and regulators of the lipid and cholesterol metabolism, could provide some clues to what may be happening.",0
Different factors can partially explain the discrepancies found in food preferences.,0
"Regarding the time exposure to diet, Palou et al.",0
(2010) described a higher preference for a fat-rich liquid diet than a carbohydrate-rich liquid diet in male offspring fed for 1 h after an adaptation period of 8 days (habituation to diet).,0
"However, our data indicated a lower preference for a novel highly-palatable food (chocolate mixture) than the familiar standard diet in RC females when they were exposed for 4 days.",0
"The lower acceptance to novel foods has been found in animals with protein deficiency from early gestational stages (Peregoy et al.,1972; Pettus et al.,1974) and could be associated with abnormal behaviors in adulthood related to anxiety (Peleg-Raibstein et al.,2012).",0
"Regarding the timing of restriction, protein deficiency during early pregnancy induces a less preference to a high-fat diet in the female offspring (Bellinger and Langley-Evans,2005), whereas a high preference was obtained when restriction was applied through other gestational periods (Bellinger et al.,2004; Bellinger and Langley-Evans,2005).",0
"According to our results, a maternal caloric restriction prior to mating could be critical for the less compulsive feeding observed in female offspring.",0
The tendency to lower chocolate preference suggests an increased threshold of the palatability.,0
"Interestingly, the ECS is implicated in the intake of palatable food (DiPatrizio and Simansky,2008) and the perception of sweet taste (Niki et al.,2015).",0
"Interestingly, caloric restriction induced a higher reduction in total intake in the female offspring treated with AM251.",0
"This subtle difference may indicate some alterations in the central rewarding functions of the ECS, as was previously described in animals with reduced preference for highly palatable foods (Brand et al.,2012).",0
Impact of maternal caloric restriction on the expression of the endogenous cannabinoid system in organs related to energy expenditure and metabolism\nThe sex-dependent effects of maternal caloric restriction on feeding behavior and metabolic profile in offspring can be a result of a differential re-programming in energy metabolism.,0
"Moreover, long-lasting changes in the gene expression of components of the ECS, which modulates appetite and energy homeostasis, and other key enzymes and regulators of lipid and cholesterol metabolism, were found in metabolically relevant tissues (liver and PAT) of adult offspring in a sex-dependent manner.",0
"These results likely indicate that the up-expression of the cannabinoid receptors in the hypothalamus at adulthood may result from a lower long-term cannabinoid activity that, in turn, could be produced by lower levels of eCBs and N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) in the hypothalamus of male offspring as was previous described at birth (RamÃ­rez-LÃ³pez et al.,2016).",0
This interpretation also agrees with the down-regulation of the endocannabinoid metabolism in peripheral tissues.,0
"However, the adult female offspring from calorie-restricted dams showed a decreased gene expression of Cnr1 and the eCBs-degrading enzymes Faah and Mgll in liver as well as the NAEs-synthesizing enzyme Napepld in PAT.",0
The prominent down-regulation of the eCBs-degrading enzymes in the liver of RC females may result in a different endocannabinoid signaling than that of RC males.,0
"Higher endocannabinoid levels as a result of a lower expression of the eCBs-degrading enzymes FAAH and MAGL in liver can be associated with alterations in the lipid and cholesterol metabolism (Dinh et al.,2002; Osei-Hyiaman et al.,2005; Di Marzo and MacCarrone,2008), due to the fact that both eCBs anandamide (AEA) and 2-AG can inhibit the gene expression of apolipoprotein A1, the primary protein component of HDL, through the activation of CB1 receptors in hepatocytes (Haas et al.,2012).",0
"Some studies have also noticed that the metabolic profile exhibited by offspring depends on the sex (Desai et al.,2007a; Palou et al.,2010; Suzuki et al.,2010).",0
"Despite of these alterations, in general, the female phenotype seems less severely affected after the exposure to maternal undernutrition in early development.",0
"Interestingly, the CB2 receptor activation was associated with anti-obesity effects (Verty et al.,2015) and a decreased risk for cardiovascular diseases.",0
"For instance, the gene deletion of the 2-AG-degrading enzyme Mgll has been linked to attenuation of diet-induced insulin resistance and improvement of atherosclerosis via CB2 activation (Taschler et al.,2011; Vujic et al.,2016).",0
"Taken in account the lower impact of the exposure to undernutrition observed in females in particular, and the lower risk of cardiovascular diseases described in females in general (Blenck et al.,2016), we can speculate that the CB2 receptor up-regulation may play a protective role in adverse metabolic conditions.",0
"The higher gene expression of Cnr1 in the hypothalamus, which was subtly more evident in male than female offspring from caloric-restricted dams, was not so clear in previous studies (Matias et al.,2003).",0
Matias et al.,0
"(2003) demonstrated a decrease in the hypothalamic levels of AEA (confirmed by RamÃ­rez-LÃ³pez et al.,2016) and an absence of significant changes in the gene expression of Cnr1 and Faah in the hypothalamus of weaned pups after a maternal undernutrition throughout the last part of pregnancy and/or lactation.",0
A possible explanation of this discrepancy could be related to the critical consequences of the maternal undernutrition at preconceptional periods.,0
"The up-expression of Cnr1 in the hypothalamus has been associated with the leptin resistance in obesity (Thanos et al.,2008; Cardinal et al.,2012).",0
This fact agrees with the increased body weight and the higher plasma levels of leptin in RC male offspring despite of the absence of hyperphagia or alterations in hypothalamic endocannabinoid machinery.,0
"Several biologic mechanisms underlying the nutritional programming, which become altered after the exposure to a maternal restricted diet during pregnancy, have been identified.",0
"It was described that long-term undernutrition from early stages lead to higher gene expression of Cnr1 in several brain regions of the leptin-deficient obese Zucker rats (Thanos et al.,2008).",0
"These findings indicate that leptin action and, therefore, the normal function of leptin receptors reduces the endocannabinoid tone and CB1 receptor activity (Di Marzo et al.,2001).",0
"Regarding the absence of hyperphagia, it is important to note that the food intake has been associated with the cannabinoid activation in specific hypothalamic areas (Soria-Gomez et al.,2014).",0
"However, previous studies suggested that specific CB1 receptor deletion in the hypothalamus was able to decrease body weight and increase energy expenditure, but was not accompanied with changes in food intake (Cardinal et al.,2012).",0
"Interestingly, recent studies have documented epigenetic modifications or affectation of adrenocortical growth in offspring after maternal dietary restriction around the time of conception (Nicholas et al.,2013; Zhang et al.,2013), pointing out the importance of the periconceptional window in the metabolic programming.",0
"Therefore, an alteration in the hypothalamic levels of endocannabinoids in newborn animals, as was previously described by RamÃ­rez-LÃ³pez et al.",0
"(2016), could impair the sympathetic neurotransmission and hormones involved in energy metabolism (Di Marzo et al.,2001; Keimpema et al.,2013,2014; Cristino et al.,2014).",0
"Thus, the down-expression of the eCBs-degrading enzymes Faah and Mgll in the PAT of RC male offspring is consistent with an obese phenotype, hyperleptinemia, adiposity, and alterations in lipid metabolism in absence of increased food intake, as was previously described in animals with deficiency of FAAH and MAGL (Tourino et al.,2010; Geurts et al.,2015).",0
"In contrast, the decreased gene expression of the 2-AG-synthesizing enzymes Dagl Î± and Dagl Î² is opposed to what was previously found in the adipose tissue of obese subjects (Engeli et al.,2014).",0
"Therefore, the down-regulation of the endocannabinoid machinery in the adipose tissue of male offspring at adulthood may result in a putative compensatory effect in order to respond to an unbalanced endocannabinoid tone originated at birth after maternal undernutrition.",0
"The down-expression of all these elements in PAT indicates lower energy expenditure in RC males, which agrees with the increased perirenal adiposity and the higher levels of triglycerides in plasma.",0
"These features were also linked to an impairment of the browning process of the white adipose tissue (Geurts et al.,2015).",0
"Despite we found a decrease in the gene expression of Ppar Î³, opposite results after the exposure to undernutrition (Bispham et al.,2005) and similar results after malnutrition during early development have been documented (Ahmad et al.,2013; Reynolds et al.,2014).",0
"Interestingly, the decreased gene expression of Ppar Î³ has been linked to inflammatory processes associated with obesity and insulin resistance (Odegaard et al.,2007; Reynolds et al.,2014), an issue that enhances the importance of the inflammatory responses in the developmental programming.",0
"As these nuclear receptors has been also linked to the activation of fatty-acid Î²-oxidation and insulin sensitivity (Auwerx,1999; Minnich et al.,2001), their decreased levels in RC females might be associated to alterations in lipid and glucose metabolism (Liu et al.,2015).",0
"The down-expression of these elements suggests a reduction of fatty-acid and cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver of RC females, which could partially explain the altered levels of the lipid carriers high-density, low-density and very low-density lipoproteins (HDL, LDL, and HLDL) in plasma.",0
"The HDL was 10-fold reduced in the plasma of RC females, which indicates a significant reduction of the outlet rate of fat molecules (cholesterol, phospholipids and triglycerides) from cells.",0
"In contrast, the LDL was two-fold increased in the plasma of RC females, which is strongly associated with artherosclerosis within the artery wall and poses a risk for cardiovascular disease.",0
"Similarly to human cohort studies, our results emphasize the importance of early life programming as the exposure to undernutrition during early development increases the risk from suffering features of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease later in life (Desai et al.,2005,2007b; Jimenez-Chillaron et al.,2005; Yura et al.,2005; Breton et al.,2009; Palou et al.,2010; Suzuki et al.,2010; Lukaszewski et al.,2011; Theys et al.,2011).",0
Sexual dimorphisms: an open question\nA major finding of this study is the appearance of sexual dimorphisms on the effects of maternal caloric restriction in the adult offspring.,0
"The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is also implicated in metabolic and behavioral mechanisms involved in fetal programming such as leptin signaling (Di Marzo et al.,2001) or dopaminergic system (Melis et al.,2004).",0
Differences extend not only to metabolic parameters and gene expression but also to behavioral responses.,0
This limitation has to be considered in the interpretation of the data and further research will be addressed to evaluate the reasons for the sex-dimorphic alterations.,0
"Conclusion\nAs conclusion, our results demonstrated that the exposure to a moderate maternal restricted diet from the preconceptional period predisposed for the development of features related to the metabolic syndrome, affected subtly the feeding behavior and altered the gene expression of relevant regulators of the lipid and cholesterol metabolism, including the endocannabinoid signaling system, in metabolically-relevant tissues (hypothalamus, liver and PAT) of adult offspring in a sex specific-manner.",0
"Importantly, this evidence supports the idea that the contribution of the endocannabinoid system in the early life programming could be critical.",0
Our findings represent an important key point to understand the complexity of the fetal programming process and might be particularly useful in the searching of efficient therapies against a malprogramming.,0
Further studies should be performed to clarify the role of the endocannabinoid system and other homeostatic mechanisms implicated in the process of nutritional programming.,0
"Long-term effects of ECS activation could finally increase the risk from suffering metabolic diseases that lead to obesity and metabolic syndrome (Tibirica,2010; Cristino et al.,2014).",0
"Additionally, it has been revealed that some ECS components are sensible to dietary conditions.",0
"As the main endogenous agonists (anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol) of the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 are derivatives of fatty acids, it has been demonstrated that the lipid profile of the diet could modify the endocannabinoid levels (Artmann et al.,2008) in some tissues, including the early developing brain (Berger et al.,2001).",0
"Consequently, the cannabinoid receptor activity may be modified.",0
"Furthermore, the gene expression of the ECS components could be modified after the exposure to different dietary conditions (Bello et al.,2012).",0
The level of 25-hydroxy Vitamin D (25-OH Vit D) and the sources of Vitamin D intake and the frequency of food consumption rich in Vitamin D were investigated.,0
"This is comparable with the prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency among the general population in Beijing area (LC-MS method, 11% if diagnosed with serum 25-OH Vitamin D level <25\xa0nmol/L, or 55% if diagnosed with serum 25-OH Vitamin D level between 25 and 50\xa0nmol/L method) [5].",0
"The Vitamin D deficiency level identified in this study was 20.4%, which is lower than those identified in the studies discussed previously.",0
Sunlight exposure time has an important impact on Vitamin D3 level.,0
The seasonal variations of serum 25-OH Vitamin D level detected in these subjects are consistent with natural environmental changes in the area of residence.,0
"Thus, the strength and duration of sunlight exposure become the main factors affecting the Vitamin D level in their bodies.",0
"Besides sunlight exposure, Vitamin D supplementation is also an important factor that affects serum 25-OH Vitamin D level among women with GDM.",0
This study finds that 85.7% of pregnant women received supplements containing Vitamin D. Their serum 25-OH Vitamin D levels were higher than those without supplement use.,0
"In addition, participants with GDM in this study were mostly urban residents with a higher socioeconomic status.",0
"It is noted that the detection rate of serum 25-OH Vitamin D2 in the study is 19.4%, higher than the usual 5% in the general population [3].",0
"The diet records showed that the frequencies of consumption of dairy products and eggs among patients were 7.5\u2009Â±\u20093.8/week and 5.6\u2009Â±\u20092.2/week, respectively.",0
"However, only four out of nineteen participants with supplement use who was also positive for Vitamin D2 received Vitamin D2-containing supplements.",0
25-OH Vitamin D2 is also detected in the serum of these four participants.,0
"Therefore, consumption of Vitamin D2-containing supplements is associated with higher Vitamin D2 detection rate among pregnant women.",0
"However, other contributing factors could not be excluded.",0
"Previous studies identify edible fungi as the primary plant-based dietary source of Vitamin D. However, edible fungi were hardly seen in the dietary records among participants in this study.",0
Conclusion\nMost of the patients took Vitamin D supplements which may help to maintain the nutritional balance of Vitamin D.\n\nBackground\nVitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the gut and maintains adequate serum calcium and phosphate concentrations to ensure normal mineralization of the bone.,0
Such low consumption rate and amount cannot be the leading cause of high Vitamin D detection rate in these participants.,0
"Accumulation of Vitamin D2 in food chain, such as from poultry fed with Vitamin D2 fortified feeds and their eggs, also contribute to elevated Vitamin D2 levels in human bodies.",0
"As a result, higher egg consumption among participants in this study may explain the higher detection rate of Vitamin D2.",0
Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults [1].,0
"In addition, researchers find dairy products in China are mainly fortified with Vitamin D3, which will not translate into higher Vitamin D2 detection rate among participants.",0
"Conclusions\nIn summary, 20.4% pregnant women with GDM in their middle and late pregnancy are deficient in Vitamin D, though their Vitamin D levels were higher than the general population.",0
"It is necessary to increase exogenous Vitamin D intake in this population especially in fall and winter, when there is an increase of Vitamin D deficiency in Beijing area.",0
"This group often uses dietary supplements containing Vitamin D. They also have a Vitamin D2 detection rate of 19.4%, which can be explained by consuming edible fungi or supplements containing Vitamin D2.",0
"Alternatively, higher eggs and poultry consumption may also explain the high detection rate.",0
Further study is needed to confirm this.,0
"Study has shown that exposing edible mushroom to ultraviolet B light could increase its Vitamin D2 content and raise serum 25-OH VitD2 in healthy adults [2,3].",0
Study also has shown that serum 25-OH VitD2 detection rate is less than 5% in China [4].,0
Serum 25-OH Vitamin D level is recognized as the best indicator of Vitamin D status.,0
"Investigation of the vitamin D nutritional status in women with gestational diabetes mellitus in Beijing\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nVitamin D deficiency is a common issue, which has relation with GDM, during the pregnant period.",0
"Adequate Vitamin D status (>30\xa0nmol/L) significantly promotes calcium absorption and reduces rickets risks, which was deemed as good Vitamin D nutritional status.",0
"Some researchers defined serum 25-OH Vitamin D lower than 50\xa0nmol/L as diagnostic criteria for Vitamin D deficiency, 50â€“75\xa0nmol/L as inadequate, and higher than 75\xa0nmol/L as adequate [4,6,7].",0
"Previously, ELISA was used to measure serum 25-OH Vitamin D level.",0
"Recently, LC-MS/MS became the gold standard of measuring Vitamin D level due to its ability to differentiate and accurately quantify the two subgroups of 25-OH Vitamin D (25-OH Vitamin D2 and 25-OH Vitamin D3); (2) high specificity, which allows differentiation of the target molecule from other metabolic intermediates, as well as avoiding interference as seen in immunological methods; (3) high sensitivity, which allows detection at ng/mL level.",0
Such method allows nutrition researchers to identify Vitamin D food sources and evaluate dietary pattern.,0
To study the Vitamin D nutritional status of pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in the middle and late pregnancy and analyze the different sources of Vitamin D intake.,0
Vitamin D deficiency is closely associated with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM).,0
"Vitamin D is also a potential immunosuppressant, which down-regulates the expression of pro-inflammation markers, such as TNF-Î± and IL-2, among pregnant women with GDM [8].",0
There is an increased risk of Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy [9].,0
Study has found that the prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is 66â€“96% [7].,0
"Currently, it is recommended to use multiVitamin or calcium supplements containing Vitamin D for women during pregnancy to increase their Vitamin D intake.",0
"The dosage is based on dietary intake recommendations [10,11].",0
It is important to pay attention to Vitamin D nutritional status in GDM pregnancy nutrition management.,0
"Using a new assessment technique, we investigated Vitamin D nutritional status among outpatients with GDM in our hospital, and analyzed Vitamin D sources and its association with dietary pattern.",0
"The serum level of 25-OH Vitamin D2 in the intervention group was 11.61\u2009Â±\u20096.71 (6.06â€“24.71) nmol/L, however, the serum 25-OH Vitamin D2 level in the fourteen cases in the control group was too low to be detected with the current technology (Table\xa02).",0
Discussion\nNormal Vitamin D level is one of the nutritional management goals for women with GDM.,0
"Most women (66â€“96%) in their middle and late pregnancy in Beijing are Vitamin D deficient if diagnosed with the criteria of serum 25-OH Vitamin D level <50\xa0nmol/L (ELISA method), as indicated in two studies from Department of Endocrinology and Department of Laboratory Medicine in Peking Union Medical College Hospital [6].",0
Nutrition for the primary care provider\nThis book focuses on the various nutritional aspects of the current needs of the society at large and for the health practitioners.,0
"Overall, this book will be of benefit to postgraduates in the field of nutrition, nutritionists in hospitals and physicians.",0
"The chapters on nutrition in pregnancy, exercise, food allergies and intolerance, etc are informative and will be a good read for students in the respective field.",0
"It would have been worthwhile to include some more topics such as management of severely acute malnutrition, examples of high, low and moderate glycaemic index foods, how to read food labels (with examples), etc and also additional references for further reading would have been beneficial as the chapters are a quick guide to appraise the topic.",0
Maternal intake of sugar during pregnancy and childhood respiratory and\xa0atopic outcomes\n\nAbstract\nThe possible role of maternal consumption of free sugar during pregnancy in the inception of respiratory and atopic diseases has not been studied.,0
"We analysed associations between maternal intake of free sugar in pregnancy (estimated by a food frequency questionnaire), and current doctor-diagnosed asthma, wheezing, hay fever, eczema, atopy, serum total IgE and lung function in children aged 7â€“9\u2005years (n=8956 with information on maternal diet in pregnancy and at least one outcome of interest).",0
"When evidence for associations persisted, we considered other factors which can be considered either as potential confounders or potential mediators of associations between maternal free sugar intake in pregnancy and childhood outcomes, i.e.",0
"[""We therefore adjusted additionally for maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) (self-reported), gestational age at delivery, birthweight, maternal weight gain during pregnancy (all abstracted from obstetric records) and child's BMI at age 7\u2005years (based on measured height and weight at clinic) (see supplementary figure E1 showing a directed acyclic graph).""]",0
"In order to assess confounding arising from other dimensions of diet, we additionally adjusted separately for maternal intake of vitamin E, zinc, selenium, n -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), n -6 PUFAs, and total fruits and vegetables in pregnancy [1,29â€“31].",0
"[""To investigate confounding by post-natal sugar intake, we adjusted additionally for child's sugar intake at age 3\u2005years.""]",0
"In order to investigate potential unmeasured confounding by genetic or shared environmental or lifestyle factors, we used a parental comparison approach, whereby effect estimates for maternal sugar intake in pregnancy were compared with effect estimates for maternal and paternal sugar intake after pregnancy.",0
"If there is a causal intrauterine effect, one would expect a stronger association with maternal intake in pregnancy than with maternal post-natal intake or paternal intake (the latter two exposures cannot have a direct biological effect on offspring asthma risk) (see further details in the supplementary material) [32,33].",0
"After controlling for potential confounders, maternal intake of free sugar was positively associated with atopy (OR for highest versus lowest quintile of sugar intake 1.38, 95% CI 1.06â€“1.78; per quintile p-trend=0.006) and atopic asthma (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.23â€“3.29; per quintile p-trend=0.004).",0
"To correct for potential loss to follow-up bias, we used inverse probability weighting and assigned to each woman a weight that was the inverse of the probability of her selection for given values of covariates (see further details in the supplementary material) [35].",0
Characteristics of the 8956 motherâ€“child pairs who were included in the analyses and those of the 3122 motherâ€“child pairs with information on maternal diet who were excluded because of incomplete outcome data are compared in supplementary table E1.,0
Their offspring were more likely to have weighed less at birth and to have had a lower BMI at age 7\u2005years (table\xa01).,0
"After adjustment for potential confounders, there was weak evidence for positive associations between maternal free sugar intake in pregnancy and childhood doctor-diagnosed asthma and childhood wheeze (OR comparing highest versus lowest quintile 1.31, 95% CI 0.98â€“1.75; per quintile p - trend=0.09 and 1.42, 95% CI 1.05â€“1.92; per quintile p - trend=0.08, respectively), and stronger evidence for a positive association with atopy at age 7\u2005years (OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.06â€“1.78; per quintile p - trend=0.006) (table 2).",0
We have investigated whether a high intake of free sugar in pregnancy is associated with adverse respiratory and atopic outcomes in the offspring in a large population-based UK birth cohort.,0
The exclusion of 17 women with implausible energy intake estimates did not alter the main results nor did exclusion of mothers with diabetes.,0
Our longitudinal findings linking maternal free sugar intake in pregnancy to childhood atopy and atopic asthma extend the ecological results and allow stronger causal inference.,0
"We were unable to assess whether associations between maternal intake of free sugar in pregnancy and childhood atopy and atopic asthma persist beyond the age of 7\u2005years, as no data on atopy (only data on asthma status) have been collected in ALSPAC children after the age of 7\u2005years.",0
"Furthermore, loss to follow-up bias has been shown to only slightly modify associations in longitudinal studies, including in ALSPAC [49], and the results of our inverse probability weighting analysis [35] confirmed that loss to follow-up is unlikely to have biased our results.",0
If these findings are replicated we would design an appropriate intervention study in pregnancy to establish or refute causality.,0
"Post hoc analysis showed a positive association between maternal intake of free sugar and atopic asthma (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.23â€“3.29; per quintile p - trend=0.004) (table 3).",0
"[""Further investigation of potential confounding/mediation of main findings and sensitivity analyses\nAdditional separate adjustment for maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational age at delivery, birthweight, maternal weight gain during pregnancy and child's BMI at age 7\u2005years did not substantially alter the main findings and therefore no further formal mediation analysis was conducted (supplementary table E3).""]",0

"We studied associations between maternal free sugar intake in pregnancy and childhood asthma status phenotypes, and did not observe any association (supplementary table E5).",0
"These associations were not confounded by intake of sugar in early childhood, which was unrelated to these outcomes.",0
"Maternal â€œdiabetesâ€ was not associated with any respiratory or atopic outcome, but was associated with higher birthweight.",0
"Discussion\nIn this population-based birth cohort study, we found that a higher maternal intake of free sugar during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of atopy and atopic asthma in the offspring, independently of sugar intake in early childhood.",0
"To the best of our knowledge, these are novel findings.",0
"While a previous ecological study reported a positive correlation between perinatal consumption of sugar and severe childhood asthma symptoms [9], the limitations of ecological studies for inferring causality are well known (not least because of the high likelihood of confounding) [36].",0
"Furthermore, that study was unable to specifically investigate the potential role of maternal intake of sugar during pregnancy nor the specific role of free sugar.",0
"Interestingly, the findings for atopy became stronger when we examined the association with multiple sensitisation.",0
"Although previous cross-sectional studies have reported a positive association between childhood consumption of sugar-containing drinks, including fruit juice, and asthma [5â€“8], intake of free sugar in early childhood in our study was not associated with any respiratory or atopic outcome.",0
Mechanisms\nWe speculate that high maternal fructose consumption may underlie the positive associations between maternal intake of free sugar and childhood atopy and atopic asthma.,0
"Our results suggest that a higher maternal intake of free sugar during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of atopy and atopic asthma in the offspring, independently of sugar intake in early childhood.",0
"Fructose, which is a major component of added sugars, and is present naturally in fruit juice and in sweetened drinks as added sucrose (ratio of fructose/glucose 50/50%) or isolated fructose, has been mooted as driving previous cross-sectional findings linking sugar-containing beverage consumption to asthma in children [7,8].",0
"A prospective randomised controlled trial in adults showed that dietary sugar, and especially fructose, increased levels of C-reactive protein [37].",0
"Fructose also causes generation of uric acid [38], and experimental evidence in mice suggests that uric acid may be an essential initiator and amplifier of T-helper cell type 2 (Th2) immunity and allergic inflammation, through activation of inflammatory dendritic cells [39].",0
"Alternatively, fructose might influence atopic immune responses by conditioning the gut microbiome [40,41].",0
The potential of maternal diet in pregnancy to influence inception of offspring allergic airways disease through this mechanism was recently confirmed in a mouse model [42].,0
We therefore propose that one explanation for our main findings is that high fetal exposure to fructose may cause persistence of Th2 immune responses post-natally and allergic inflammation in the developing lung.,0
"In contrast to a previous study which reported a link between gestational diabetes and risk of atopic eczema and atopy in early childhood [43], we found no association between maternal diabetes during pregnancy and any outcome in the offspring, although, as expected [44], maternal diabetes was associated with higher birthweight.",0
Abstract:SHORT\nHigher maternal intake of sugar in pregnancy may increase the risk of allergy and allergic asthma in the offspring http://ow.ly/zehc30bFswP\n\nIntroduction\nThere has been considerable interest in the role of maternal diet in pregnancy in the aetiology of childhood asthma and atopy [1].,0
The lack of a relation with maternal diabetes would suggest that higher fetal exposure to glucose is unlikely to explain our main findings.,0
"[""While high fructose consumption has been proposed as a risk factor for obesity [45], we found no evidence to suggest that the associations between maternal free sugar intake and atopy and atopic asthma in the offspring were mediated by maternal BMI, gestational weight gain or child's BMI, nor by prematurity or low birthweight, assuming key assumptions necessary for mediation analyses were met [46,47].""]",0
"Strengths and limitations\nStrengths of the ALSPAC birth cohort include its size and population-based prospective design, rich information on numerous potential lifestyle and dietary confounders (including information on childhood free sugar intake and parental sugar intake outside of pregnancy), and detailed phenotypic outcome measurements.",0
"Although the FFQ that we used had not been formally calibrated against other instruments such as diet diaries, it was based on the one used by Yarnell et\xa0al.",0
"[48], which has been validated against weighed dietary records and modified in the light of a more recent weighed dietary survey [13].",0
The FFQ lacked quantitative information on soft drink consumption and this will have led to underestimation of maternal free sugar intake during pregnancy.,0
"However, as misclassification of maternal free sugar intake in pregnancy is likely to have been random with respect to childhood outcomes, the strength of associations may have been underestimated.",0
"We were unable to assess associations with maternal sugar intake in early pregnancy; however, intakes in early and late pregnancy are likely to be highly correlated.",0
"Studies have focused particularly on the potentially beneficial effects of antioxidants, following the hypothesis that a declining intake of antioxidants in Westernised countries has led to a reduction in pulmonary antioxidant defences, and hence to an increase in prevalence of asthma and atopy in recent decades [2].",0
"We think that confounding of the main findings by lifestyle or other aspects of maternal diet in pregnancy is unlikely, as we controlled for numerous potential confounders in the analyses, including nutrients and foods that have been previously linked to childhood asthma and atopy.",0
"[""Importantly, the main findings were not confounded by the offspring's free sugar intake in early childhood.""]",0
"While the possibility of residual confounding cannot be ruled out, the null findings for maternal and paternal free sugar intakes after pregnancy make confounding by unmeasured familial behaviours linked to sugar intake and asthma risk a less likely explanation.",0
"As with any longitudinal study, we cannot rule out the possibility that exclusion of motherâ€“child pairs without complete information might have biased our findings.",0
"However, it could be argued that, for our results to be totally spurious in those included in our analysis (and for the associations to be truly null in the population as a whole), associations in the excluded motherâ€“child pairs would have to be in the opposite direction and much stronger, compared with the positive associations we reported in the included motherâ€“child pairs, which seems extremely unlikely.",0
"In view of the multiple analyses carried out and the post hoc nature of the findings for atopic asthma, we cannot exclude the possibility that the main findings occurred by chance; hence, they should be interpreted with caution.",0
"An alternative hypothesis, which has received less attention, is that the epidemic of asthma and atopy in the West could partly be explained by an increasing dietary intake of foods and constituents which may be harmful.",0
"Given the a priori nature of the hypothesis being tested, and the fact that some outcomes of interest are highly correlated, it did not seem appropriate to correct for multiple testing.",0
"However, we plan to re-examine this hypothesis in another birth cohort to see if we can replicate the main findings.",0
Conclusions and public health implications\nWe conclude that a higher maternal intake of free sugar during pregnancy may increase the risk of atopy and atopic asthma in the offspring.,0
"Given the very high levels of sugar consumption currently in the West, where childhood allergy and asthma are so prevalent, confirmation of a causal link would raise exciting prospects for the primary prevention of these disorders.",0
"Between 1970 and 2000, there was a 25% increase in the per capita consumption of all refined sugars in the USA, matching a worldwide trend [3].",0
"Current international dietary guidelines advise people to reduce their consumption of sugar, and more particularly free sugars, which comprise sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides) added to foods or drinks by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, and sugars naturally present in honey, syrups and unsweetened fruit juices [4].",0
"While in children a high consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages [5â€“7] and fruit juice [7,8] has been linked to asthma, and particularly atopic asthma [7], the relation between total maternal consumption of free sugar during pregnancy and respiratory and atopic outcomes in the offspring has not been studied.",0
"One ecological study reported a correlation between perinatal consumption of sugar and severe childhood asthma symptoms [9], but could not specifically address maternal sugar intake in pregnancy.",0
"A recent Danish birth cohort study investigated the relation between soft drink consumption, but not total free sugar intake, during pregnancy and childhood asthma and allergic rhinitis [10].",0
"We aimed to study the relationship between maternal intake of free sugar during pregnancy and respiratory and atopic outcomes in the offspring in a population-based birth cohort, the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.",0
"The FFQ was used to estimate total energy intake and daily nutrient intake, by multiplying the daily frequency of consumption of a food by the nutrient content [14] of a standard portion [15] of that food, and summing this for all the foods consumed.",0
In this way free sugar intake was estimated.,0
Potential confounders\nWe selected potential confounding factors which are known (from existing literature) to be associated with one or more of the outcomes of interest [20].,0
In Model 1 we adjusted for total energy intake only.,0
In Model 2 we adjusted additionally for all potential confounders listed above.,0
"Vitamin D deficiency in Thailandâ˜†\nVitamin D deficiency has received increased attention over the past several years since vitamin D may play an important role not only in bone metabolism but also in a variety of non-skeletal diseases such as diabetes mellitus, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, cardiovascular diseases and cancer1,2,3.",0
"[""Latitude is an important determinant of vitamin D status since the amount of UVB that penetrates the earth's surface decreases markedly with increasing latitude[8].""]",0
People residing near the equator should have lower prevalence of vitamin D deficiency compared to people living at high latitudes.,0
"However, according to the recent studies, vitamin D deficiency is also common in these countries10,11.",0
[18]showed in a recent study in Thai children that vitamin D deficiency was also highly prevalent in school children aged 3â€“12.9 years.,0
Thai women are at risk for vitamin D insufficiency likely due to sunscreen usage and sun avoidant behavior due to the desire to maintain a fair complexion.,0
"Living in urban areas such as in Bangkok, increases the risk of vitamin D insufficiency due to increased pollution, which decreases the amount of UVB available for cutaneous vitamin D synthesis.",0
"Thus, dietary intake of vitamin D in Thai people is generally low.",0
"In summary, despite a location near the equator where sunlight is available year round, Thai people are at risk for vitamin D insufficiency due to environmental, cultural, lifestyle and dietary factors.",0
The relatively high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency may have important health implications for Thai people as the science of vitamin D continues to be unraveled.,0

"Trajectory of vitamin D status during pregnancy in relation to neonatal birth size and fetal survival: a prospective cohort study\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nWe investigated the associations between vitamin D status in early and late pregnancy with neonatal small for gestational age (SGA), low birth weight (LBW) and preterm delivery.",0
"Results\nT1 25OHD was negatively associated with pregnancy loss and 1\xa0nmol/L increase in 25OHD was associated with 1% lower odds of pregnancy loss (OR 0.99, p \u2009=\u20090.046).",0
"Therefore, it has not been possible to ascertain whether the associations at implantation in early pregnancy differ from those during the fetal growth spurt in late pregnancy.",0
"T3 25OHD â‰¥\u2009100\xa0nmol/L (equal to 40\xa0ng/ml) was associated with lower odds of SGA (OR 0.3, p \u2009=\u20090.031) and LBW (OR 0.2, p \u2009=\u20090.046), compared to vitamin D deficiency (25OHD <\u200930\xa0nmol/L, or 12\xa0ng/ml).",0
"Our objectives were to study the associations between vitamin D status in both early and late pregnancy, as well as change in vitamin D status during pregnancy with neonatal SGA, LBW and preterm delivery.",0
Associations between vitamin D status in early pregnancy and pregnancy loss were also studied.,0
Pregnancy loss before gestational week 22 was based on self-report data and medical records to verify miscarriage were not available.,0
"Season was coded as a binary variable, since this explained 30% of vitamin D status in a previous study in pregnant women at the same latitude [16].",0
"These groups were chosen to study whether vitamin D insufficiency (30â€“50\xa0nmol/L), sufficiency (â‰¥\u200950\xa0nmol/L) or high status (â‰¥\u200975 or â‰¥\u2009100\xa0nmol/L) was associated with the outcomes studied, compared to vitamin D deficiency (<\u200930\xa0nmol/L).",0
Tobacco use and vitamin D supplement use were also investigated as potential confounders but did not show any confounding effect and were thus not included in the final models.,0
"Correlation between continuous T1 25OHD and continuous change in 25OHD was low ( r \u2009=\u2009âˆ’\u20090.22, p \u2009<\u20090.001) and it was therefore considered acceptable to include both variables in the same model.",0
Conclusions\nVitamin D deficiency in late pregnancy was associated with higher odds of SGA and LBW.,0
"These models were adjusted for BMI, season of conception, education level, origin and gestational age at registration to antenatal care (based on last menstrual period).",0
"Here, no confounders were included due to the small number of cases ( N \u2009=\u20099).",0
"There were no associations between the predictor T1 25OHD and the outcomes SGA, LBW and preterm delivery (Table\xa03).",0
"However, T3 25OHD was not significantly associated with preterm delivery.",0
"Pregnancy loss models are also adjusted for gestational age at registration for antenatal care\nfNo case of pregnancy loss in category\ngAdjusted for education, origin, season of conception, BMI at T1 and 25OHD at T1\nVitamin D status trajectory between T1 and T3 was inversely related to SGA, preterm and LBW (Table3).",0
"Compared to women with a large increase in 25OHD (â‰¥30\xa0nmol/L), women with a decrease in 25OHD had significantly higher OR of having a child born SGA (OR\u2009=\u20093.7, p \u2009=\u20090.002), with LBW (OR\u2009=\u20094.7, p \u2009=\u20090.014) as well as a trend toward higher odds of preterm delivery (OR\u2009=\u20092.9, p \u2009=\u20090.061).",0
"Women with a small increase in 25OHD (0â€“30\xa0nmol/L) had significantly higher OR of SGA (OR\u2009=\u20092.6, p \u2009=\u20090.019) and preterm delivery (OR\u2009=\u20092.9, p \u2009=\u20090.047) as well as a trend toward significance for LBW (OR\u2009=\u20093.1, p \u2009=\u20090.056), compared to women with a large increase.",0
Lower 25OHD in early pregnancy was only associated with pregnancy loss.,0
"Overall, lower T1 25OHD (as a continuous but not categorical variable) was associated with pregnancy loss (Table3).",0
"In unadjusted analysis, T1 25OHD was associated with IUFD and women with 25OHD <\u200930\xa0nmol/L at T1 had more than fourfold higher odds of IUFD (OR\u2009=\u20094.52, p \u2009=\u20090.034).",0
"Discussion\nWe found that higher vitamin D status among women in late, but not early, pregnancy was associated with lower probability of SGA and LBW.",0
"Vitamin D status trajectory during pregnancy was inversely associated with SGA, LBW and preterm delivery.",0
We also found that lower vitamin D status in early pregnancy was related to pregnancy loss.,0
Previous findings from the GraviD study show lower odds of preeclampsia among women with a large increase (â‰¥\u200930\xa0nmol/L) in 25OHD [3].,0
"As SGA, LBW and preterm delivery are related to preeclampsia; these results are consistent with the current findings.",0
"However, excluding preeclampsia cases from the analysis did not change the results.",0
"Thus, preeclampsia does not seem to mediate the associations between vitamin D status trajectory and neonatal birth size or preterm birth.",0
"Vitamin D status trajectory from early to late pregnancy was inversely associated with SGA, LBW and preterm delivery with the lowest odds among women with the highest increment in 25OHD.",0
"We have previously shown that the determinants of season-corrected change in 25OHD during pregnancy include origin, sun-exposure and dietary as well as supplementary vitamin D intake [18].",0
"As the results between change in 25OHD and neonatal birth size and preterm delivery remained after adjustment for season of conception, origin and vitamin D supplementation, vitamin D status trajectory can be suspected to play a role in healthy pregnancy.",0
"Vitamin D has been shown to facilitate the transport of nutrients across the placenta [20,21], which could contribute to fetal growth [22].",0
Vitamin D status could also facilitate fetal development by regulating placental inflammation [23].,0
"Thus, both higher vitamin D status in late pregnancy and gestational vitamin D status trajectory can be suspected to play a role in healthy pregnancy.",0
It is also possible that the associations between fetal growth and maternal vitamin D status are due to residual confounding or reverse causation.,0
Whether vitamin D metabolism is altered in placental dysfunction in unclear and warrants further investigation.,0
"Our results indicates that 25OHD at T3 but not at T1 is associated with SGA and LBW, despite better statistical power at T1 due to more 25OHD samples and subsequently more cases of SGA, LBW and preterm birth.",0
"Also, maternal 25OHD <\u200928\xa0nmol/L in late, but not early, pregnancy have been associated with lower infant birth size and shorter gestational length in a smaller longitudinal study [8].",0
"We found the lowest odds of SGA among women with the highest T3 25OHD concentration, â‰¥100\xa0nmol/L.",0
"Survival analysis could therefore not be performed, as time to event data were missing.",0
This finding is partly consistent with previous studies where 25OHD concentrations of 25â€“30\xa0nmol/L were associated with higher probability of SGA [5â€“7].,0
The study by Burris et al.,0
"[6] sampled women in gestational week 26â€“28, and found a higher OR for SGA than the two studies that sampled women in T1.",0
This could be interpreted as support of our finding that late rather than early pregnancy vitamin D status is the stronger predictor of fetal growth restriction.,0
Our results also concur with findings by Morley et al.,0
that late but not early pregnancy 25OHD was related to gestational length and neonatal birth size [8].,0
Our results could also indicate that it takes time for changes in vitamin D metabolism to manifest as changes in circulating 25OHD.,0
"We did not see a U-shaped association between early pregnancy vitamin D status and SGA, as previously indicated [9].",0
"Background\nPlacental pathology is often found in pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth restriction, preeclampsia or intrauterine fetal death.",0
Sampling was evenly distributed across the seasons and time of year cannot explain the high proportion with high 25OHD concentrations.,0
"Supplementation can therefore only partly explain the large proportion with high vitamin D status, and other likely contributors are pregnancy associated endocrine changes and possibly lifestyle factors.",0
"To our knowledge, ours is one of the first studies to find associations between vitamin D status and pregnancy loss.",0
The 25OHD concentration has been shown to have immunological effects in women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss [12].,0
"Two previous studies have investigated but not found any association between 25OHD and miscarriage [5,13].",0
"One earlier study, from Denmark, found that lower vitamin D status in early pregnancy was associated with pregnancy loss in the first trimester [24].",0
We found that pregnancy loss was associated with lower 25OHD when expressed on a continuous but not categorical scale.,0
"As most women with high vitamin D status were born in Sweden and thus more likely to be familiar with the Swedish health-care system, it is possible that they registered earlier for antenatal care and were more likely to report pregnancy loss.",0
"It is associated with inadequate invasion of extravillous trophoblasts and inadequate angiogenesis, with insufficient conversion of arterial spiral arteries in the decidua [1].",0
"However, the models were adjusted for gestational age at registration for antenatal care.",0
"Despite few cases of IUFD in the GraviD cohort, our results suggest that vitamin D deficiency in early pregnancy may be linked to IUFD.",0
"These results need confirmation, preferably by adjusted statistical analysis as confounding can be expected, which was not possible in our present study due to few cases.",0
These processes are complex and normal development is dependent on several factors.,0
"Strengths of this study are that the GraviD cohort is representative of the general pregnant population in terms of origin, education, parity, BMI and tobacco use [25], which increases the external validity of the findings.",0
"Also, gestational age at delivery was estimated by routine ultrasound, which is considered more accurate than dating by last menstrual period [26].",0
"A limitation of this study is that information on pregnancy loss, except IUFD, was self-reported.",0
"The information on pregnancy loss is likely correct, albeit without conclusive information on the time of fetal demise.",0
"In addition, vitamin D status among women who terminated the pregnancy was not assessed.",0
"Since there were few cases of SGA based on birth weight alone, the definition of SGA used in this study was based on birth weight and/or length.",0
"Therefore, the definition used in this study is likely to be relevant.",0
Vitamin D status (measured as 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD)) of pregnant women has been inversely associated with adverse gestational outcomes and associated with uteroplacental dysfunction [2].,0
Another limitation is that data on physical activity during pregnancy was only available for a subset of the women and was therefore not used.,0
"While the GraviD study indicates an association between T3 25OHD and consequences of placental insufficiency, change in 25OHD during pregnancy might be a stronger predictor of placental dysfunction, as it is associated with SGA, LBW and preterm delivery.",0
The lowest odds of SGA and LBW are found among women with the largest increments in 25OHD (â‰¥\u200930\xa0nmol/L).,0
"Interestingly, vitamin D status at T1- around the time the maternal blood flow of the placenta is fully developed- is only related to pregnancy loss.",0
"Conclusion\nIn conclusion, lower early pregnancy 25OHD was associated with pregnancy loss.",0
"High vitamin D status in late, but not early, pregnancy was associated with lower odds of SGA and LBW.",0
We have previously shown that higher vitamin D status in late pregnancy and larger increase in vitamin D status during pregnancy is associated with lower risk of preeclampsia [3].,0
"Change in 25OHD during pregnancy was associated with SGA, LBW and preterm delivery, with the lowest odds for women with an increment in 25OHD â‰¥\u200930\xa0nmol/L.",0
Both higher late pregnancy vitamin D status and gestational vitamin D status trajectory can be suspected to play a role in healthy pregnancy.,0
Associations have also been shown between vitamin D insufficiency (<\u200950\xa0nmol/L) and increased risk of infant small for gestational age (SGA) and low birth weight (LBW) [4].,0
"Circulating concentrations of 25OHD below 25 or 30\xa0nmol/L have been associated with 50â€“300% increased odds of SGA, compared to higher concentrations [5â€“7].",0
"However, there is also limited evidence for a U-shaped association where high 25OHD concentrations (>\u200980\xa0nmol/L) may be related to higher risk of SGA [9].",0
"Furthermore, associations between vitamin D status and pregnancy loss were studied.",0
"Thus, the association between vitamin D status and neonatal birth size is not clear and warrants further investigation.",0
A recent meta-analysis of 10 studies concluded that 25OHD concentrations <\u200950\xa0nmol/L were associated with an approximately 30% increased risk of preterm delivery [10].,0
Bodnar et al.,0
found that early pregnancy 25OHD concentrations <\u200975\xa0nmol/L were associated with higher risk of both medically indicated and spontaneous preterm delivery [11].,0
"Lower vitamin D status has also been associated with a medical history of recurrent miscarriage [12] but only two prospective studies have investigated this, without finding that lower 25OHD concentrations increases the risk of pregnancy loss [5,13].",0
Both these prospective studies had relatively few cases of pregnancy loss and may therefore have been insufficiently powered to study this association.,0
"Thus, the association between vitamin D status and risk of miscarriage needs further investigation.",0
"To our knowledge, no previous study has related 25OHD concentration in both early and late pregnancy to neonatal outcomes related to placental dysfunction.",0
Major Maternal Dietary Patterns during Early Pregnancy and Their Association with Neonatal Anthropometric Measurement\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nAnthropometric measurements of newborn infant are widely assessed as determinants of maternal nutrition.,0
"So, the purpose of the current study was to investigate the association between major maternal dietary patterns and neonatal anthropometric measurements including body weight, head circumference, and height.",0
This study demonstrated a significant association between high adherences to western dietary pattern and chance of having low birth weight infant.,0
"However, such associations were not seen with healthy and traditional dietary pattern.",0
Earlier studies have mostly examined the effects of particular nutrients or foods during gestational period on neonatal anthropometric measurements [13] and few data are available linking habitual diet to neonatal anthropometric measurements.,0
Western dietary pattern as an unhealthy food choice is unable to fulfill the increased key micronutrients requirements for normal fetal growth during pregnancy and results in such adverse effects on the fetus [23].,0
Earlier studies have also shown that high-quality diet assessed by using the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) in the first trimester of pregnancy is positively associated with birth size including birth weight and birth length [15].,0
Other publication has also reported a protective effect of adherence to Mediterranean diet during pregnancy and risk of delivering a fetal growthâ€“restricted infant for weight in Atlantic area [16].,0
"In a population-based prospective study, it has been shown that women in the â€œwheat productsâ€ pattern had higher odds of having infants with the low birth weight and head circumference compared with women in the â€œrice, fish, and vegetablesâ€ pattern [24].",0
"Also, some maternal dietary patterns characterized by high intakes of vegetable, fruit, white rice [25], Vitamin C, milk, and fat [26] are associated with larger birth size of infant.",0
In contrast maternal intakes of carbohydrate were negatively associated with infant length and abdominal circumference [26].,0
Present study showed that the women with prior problematic pregnancies or higher socioeconomic status or education level were more prone to have a healthy dietary pattern.,0
These results were in line with Northstone et al.,0
"study which showed that â€œhealth consciousâ€ dietary patterns were negatively associated with decreasing educational level, age, and socioeconomic status [21].",0
"Also, dietary surveys during pregnancy have suggested the poor diet quality and quantity of low socioeconomic groups [27].",0
It can be concluded that women with low socioeconomic status need specific dietary intervention programs due to increase in nutritional demands during pregnancy.,0
Mentioned foods as an unhealthy food might have been given an adverse score in the healthy and traditional dietary patterns in the current study.,0
This might be a reason why we failed to report a significant positive association between high adherence to healthy dietary pattern and neonatal anthropometric measurements.,0
"It should be mentioned that refined grains are major source of carbohydrate intake in Iranian diet, which has been shown to be associated with higher risk of some chronic disorders.",0
"Therefore, understanding the differences between healthy, western, and traditional dietary patterns and usual Iranian dietary pattern might help interpreting the importance of the findings we reached.",0
"Overall, this study demonstrated a positive significant association between high adherences to western dietary pattern and chance of having low birth weight infant.",0
"Also, postpregnancy dietary habits and choices may be different compared with prepregnancy.",0
We cannot overlook that the long time adherence to a specific diet affects health outcomes.,0
"Another point that needs to be considered is the measurements error in nutritional assessment; this may increase the likelihood of misclassification, contributing to the discrepancy among our results.",0
Detailed information about food preparation and brands is also lacking in this instrument.,0
Conclusion\nWe found that healthier maternal dietary patterns during early pregnancy might be associated with lower risk of low birth weight.,0
Another potential drawback should be also considered.,0
Lack of funding to obtain fetal weights estimated via serial ultrasound is an issue in the analyses.,0
"It has been suggested that intrauterine growth patterns improved prediction of childhood anthropometry, above and beyond birth weight alone.",0
"Moreover, up to 70% of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants are constitutionally small (â€œsmall but healthyâ€), which make SGA birth a poor surrogate for intrauterine growth restriction [29].",0
"In this regard, intrauterine growth should be identified on the basis of measures of fetal growth patterns, rather than birth weight [30].",0
"In addition, residual confounding due to genetic backgrounds could not be excluded, although we controlled some important potential confounding factors.",0
"Therefore, these potential limitations should be considered in the interpretation of our results.",0
Further studies are required to confirm these findings.,0
Another positive point is that few studies have collected data on maternal dietary patterns and neonatal anthropometric measurements.,0
"In summary, evaluations carried out in the present study indicate that during early pregnancy mothers of low birth weight infant had a different dietary pattern and more adhered to the western dietary pattern compared to mothers of normal weight birth infant.",0
"Therefore, intrauterine growth conditions might be improved through the adoption of certain dietary patterns during pregnancy.",0
Larger studies are needed to determine whether maternal dietary patterns lead to significant modifications in neonatal anthropometric measurements.,0
Restricted fetal growth is one of the most important global public health problems which provides a foundation for developing chronic diseases throughout their life [2].,0
"Also, impaired fetal growth, in particular in head circumference, is associated with nonoptimal neurodevelopmental outcome [4].",0
"Although earlier studies have mostly examined the effects of particular nutrients or foods during gestational period on neonatal anthropometric measurements, there are few studies regarding the association of dietary patterns and mentioned measurements.",0
"There are also several evidences regarding the association between the impaired growth indices at birth and increased risk of developing some chronic disorders such as obesity, diabetes [5], cardiovascular diseases [5], endothelial dysfunction [6], nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [7], and chronic kidney disease [8].",0
"In addition to genetic factors [9], placenta structural [10] and environmental factors affect fetal growth in utero [9], and maternal nutritional status could impact on fetal growth and development [11].",0
"There is increasing evidence that nutrients [12] and some foods [13,14] play an important role in the fetal growth.",0
Earlier studies have also shown that high-quality diet in the first trimester of pregnancy is positively associated with birth size including birth weight and birth length [15].,0
"However, due to a wide range of nutrient interactions, maternal dietary patterns should be explored to achieve the association between maternal nutrition and fetal growth.",0
It is noteworthy that there are few studies assessing the birth anthropometric measurements along the maternal dietary patterns [16].,0
"Dietary patterns are different based on cultural, geographical, and regional influence in each area and can have effects on health outcomes [17,18].",0
"Limited data are available regarding the association of maternal dietary patterns and neonatal anthropometric measurements in Middle Eastern countries, where mentioned factors are different from western population [19].",0
"So, the purpose of the current study was to investigate the association between major maternal dietary patterns during the first-trimester period and neonatal anthropometric measurements including body weight, head circumference, and height.",0
Such findings will be used to implement informative interventional programs to control impaired fetal growth and develop practical policies to improve the diet quality among pregnant women.,0
Determination of Dietary Patterns\nWe applied principal component analysis in order to find major dietary patterns.,0
"Based on our interpretation of the data and of the earlier literature, these 3 factors were labeled as the healthy, western, and traditional patterns.",0
"To investigate the association between dietary patterns and neonatal anthropometric measurements, we used multivariable logistic regression models controlled for energy intake, age, and BMI.",0
"Women in the highest quartile of healthy dietary pattern were more likely to be employed and graduated and have employed husband, history of IUGR, and less history of early delivery compared with those in the lowest quartile.",0
"Women in the highest quartile of adherence to traditional dietary pattern were 20% less likely to have short height infant compared with those in the lowest quartile [OR 0.80, 95% (CI) (0.34-1.85), P < 0.93] in the final adjusted model.",0
"After adjusting for obstetrical factors (model 3), there was a positive significant relationship between adherence to western dietary pattern [OR 5.51, 95% (CI) (1.82-16.66), P = 0.001] with having low birth weight infant.",0
"Although this association became significant even after taking potential confounders into account in model 1 [OR 0.80, 95% (CI) (0.34-1.93), P < 0.01], such association was not seen in models 2 and 3.",0
Discussion\nCurrent study on 812 subjects is one of the largest studies evaluating the association between major maternal dietary patterns during the first-trimester period of pregnancy and neonatal anthropometric measurements.,0
Vitamin D levels in an Australian and New Zealand cohort and the association with pregnancy outcome\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nPregnant women are at increased susceptibility to vitamin D deficiency.,0
We aimed to compare vitamin D status in two distinct populations of pregnant women in Australia and New Zealand and to investigate the relationship between vitamin D status and pregnancy outcome.,0
"Unlike the previously published data on vitamin D in the Auckland cohort [20], serum 25(OH)D was measured using the IDS-iSYS chemiluminescent-based assay (Abacus, ALS) as per the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.",0
"Given that the month in which the serum was sampled heavily influences vitamin D status, â€œstandardisedâ€ serum 25(OH)D concentrations were calculated as previously described [34] in order to normalise against seasonal variation.",0
"Maternal age, BMI, SEI, alcohol consumption at 15\u2009Â±\u20091\xa0weeksâ€™ gestation (never/former vs. current), recreational walking (1â€“3 times/week and\u2009â‰¥\u20094 times/week vs. never), ethnicity (Caucasian vs. non-Caucasian) and recruitment site (Adelaide vs. Auckland) were significantly associated with serum 25(OH)D and along with smoking status at 15\u2009Â±\u20091\xa0weeksâ€™ gestation (never/former vs. current) included as main effects within the generalised linear models.",0
We also stratified based on fetal sex to evaluate possible effect measure modifications according to whether the mother was carry a male or female fetus.,0
"Compared to women who were recruited at the Adelaide site, women recruited in Auckland were older, had a lower BMI, less likely to smoke or drink alcohol during pregnancy and more likely to eat fruit and undertake recreational walks.",0
"Given that all these factors significantly influenced serum 25(OH)D in the linear regression model, it was unsurprising that vitamin D status of the women was significantly different between the two recruitment sites.",0
"However, after adjusting for maternal age, BMI, SEI, smoking status and alcohol consumption at 15\u2009Â±\u20091\xa0weeksâ€™ gestation, ethnicity, recreational walking and season, the women recruited in Adelaide still had significantly lower serum 25(OH)D when compared with those in Auckland (Adelaide: 58.4\u2009Â±\u200950.3 vs. Auckland: 70.2\u2009Â±\u200954.5\xa0nmol/L, P\u2009<\u20090.001) indicating the influence of other confounders not measured as part of the study on vitamin D status.",0

"It is the largest prospective cohort study to assess vitamin D status within the international SCOPE cohort, comparing and combining two distinct populations of pregnant women living at similar latitude and provides a greater understanding of vitamin D deficiency and the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes.",0
"We found, despite being at similar latitudes, circulating 25(OH)D was different between women recruited in Adelaide compared to women recruited in Auckland.",0
This was independent of diet and lifestyles factors including BMI and SEI and highlights the difficulty in understanding the role of vitamin D in pregnancy in human cohort studies.,0
"However, there was a protective association of having high vitamin D at 15\u2009Â±\u20091\xa0weeksâ€™ gestation and GDM once standardised based on month serum was sampled.",0
Conclusions\nHigh serum 25(OH)D at 15\u2009Â±\u20091\xa0weeksâ€™ gestation was shown to be protective against the development of GDM.,0
"Furthermore, there may be possible fetal sex specific differences in vitamin D status worth considering in future studies.",0
"Despite the similar latitudes of Adelaide and Auckland (Adelaide: 34.93Â°S and Auckland 36.85Â°S), serum 25(OH)D was lower in the women recruited in Adelaide.",0
"Given the significant number of characteristic and lifestyle differences between the two populations, this is not overly surprising.",0
"Previous studies have shown a positive association between socioeconomic status and vitamin D in both pregnant and non-pregnant women [36,37].",0
The lower SEI of the Adelaide women could therefore make them more susceptible to lower circulating 25(OH)D because of factors relating to disadvantage.,0
"Furthermore, increased BMI is known to be associated with reduced serum 25(OH)D [38â€“40] as adipose tissue is thought to sequester 25(OH)D [41].",0
"However, after adjusting for factors shown to be associated with vitamin D status including BMI and recreational walking, serum 25(OH)D remained significantly lower in the women recruited in Adelaide suggesting the influence of other factors not measured as part of SCOPE for example, hours spent outside in the sun.",0
"A possible association between fetal sex, vitamin D status and GDM provides further questions and encourages continual research and discussion into the role of vitamin D in pregnancy, particularly in vitamin D replete populations.",0
"As indicated by the seasonal variation in serum 25(OH)D, amongst women recruited in Adelaide, vitamin D status declined significantly from February to April whilst in the women recruited in Auckland, serum 25(OH)D in March and April remained elevated before declining.",0
Vitamin D deficiency has previously been associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes given its role in supporting insulin secretion and pancreatic Î²-cell function [42].,0
"Furthermore, inverse relationships between serum 25(OH)D and both fasting glucose and fasting insulin have been shown during pregnancy indicating poorer glycaemic control [19,43].",0
"Therefore, the protective role of high 25(OH)D 15\u2009Â±\u20091\xa0weeksâ€™ gestation against GDM, as seen with a decreased risk of GDM in women within the â€˜highâ€™ quartile of standardised vitamin D compared to moderate-high, is consistent with knowledge about vitamin D and diabetes.",0
This is also consistent with another study that observed an increased risk of GDM with vitamin D deficiency in early pregnancy (aOR: 3.40; 95% CI: 2.03â€“4.98 [17]) and offers potential physiological connections between vitamin D status and the progression of insulin resistance in pregnant women.,0
"Furthermore, studies have shown that vitamin D supports early placental development [44,45] in which, abnormal placentation can be a characteristic of a number of pregnancy complications including GDM, PE, sPTB and SGA [46].",0
Vitamin D metabolism in the placenta has been shown to be influenced by testosterone production and thus varies by fetal sex [35].,0
"Furthermore, sex specific differences in pregnancy outcome have also been reported whereby the risk of sPTB, PE and GDM are all higher in pregnancies with a male fetus [48â€“50].",0
"In this study, we observed marginal sex-specific differences between early pregnancy vitamin D status and pregnancy outcome where by high vitamin D status and carrying a male fetus was moderately associated with decreasing the risk of having any pregnancy complication.",0
"Conversely, high vitamin D status and carrying a female fetus was not associated with changing the risk of having any pregnancy complication.",0
"Indeed, for the risk of GDM an opposite effect of vitamin D status in early pregnancy was observed depending on fetal sex.",0
This is similar to that which has previously been shown in the relationship between vitamin D status at â‰¤26\xa0weeksâ€™ gestation and placental pathology in pregnancy [51] suggesting that male and female fetuses respond differently to maternal vitamin D status.,0
Lack of statistically significant associations with other pregnancy complications may reflect the fact that this was a largely vitamin D-replete population (>\u200972% with serum 25(OH)D\u2009>\u200950\xa0nmol/L) likely due to their residence latitude as low serum 25(OH)D was found in the SCOPE Ireland cohort [52].,0
"Indeed many of the studies that have assessed the association between vitamin D status and adverse pregnancy outcome that have reported statistically significant differences have been in populations with higher rates of vitamin D deficiency [2,4].",0
High dose (>\u20092000\xa0IU) vitamin D supplementation is associated with decreasing risk of pregnancy complications [23â€“25].,0
"Background\nWith an increasing prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency reported both in Australia and New Zealand, as well as worldwide [1], there is continuing interest in determining how vitamin D deficiency may influence health in pregnancy.",0
"Furthermore, multivitamin supplements available during the study period contained very little (maximum 50\xa0IU), if any, vitamin D and thus are\xa0an unlikely source of variation within the population.",0
Inconsistencies in the literature may also reflect other causative factors in which vitamin D is a mediator.,0
"During gestation, fetal demand for calcium increases and it is imperative that maternal vitamin D status remain adequate to support increased calcium absorption from the gut [54].",0
"Therefore, vitamin D status may be important in populations where dietary calcium intake is low which is unlikely in the population of women studied here.",0
"Conclusions\nIn conclusion, once standardised against month of sampling, we demonstrate a protective effect of high vitamin D with GDM.",0
"However, differences in vitamin D status between the women recruited in Adelaide and those recruited in Auckland reflect obvious difficulties in studying how vitamin D may support healthy pregnancies.",0
"A possible connection between fetal sex, vitamin D status and pregnancy complications reveals further questions and encourages continual research and discussion into the role of vitamin D in pregnancy, particularly in vitamin D replete populations.",0
"Evidence suggests that vitamin D deficiency is associated with a number of pregnancy complications including preeclampsia (PE), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) [2â€“4].",0
"However, inconsistencies between studies reflect uncertainty about the true effect of vitamin D deficiency on pregnancy outcome [5,6].",0
"This may be explained, in part, by inadequate control of related risk factors and confounders in statistical analyses, variations between assays that measure vitamin D and significant heterogeneity between studied populations [6].",0
"Hence, there is continuing interest in determining how vitamin D influences pregnancy health.",0
"In Australia and New Zealand, the deficiency cut-offs are based on the role of vitamin D in bone health where serum 25(OH)D\u2009â‰¥\u200950\xa0nmol/L at the end of winter is required for optimal musculoskeletal health [1].",0
"Furthermore, it has been established that serum 25(OH)D\u2009â‰¥\u200950\xa0nmol/L is recommended during pregnancy and lactation [7].",0
The incidence of vitamin D deficiency (Ë‚50\xa0nmol/L) is frequent among pregnant women even in areas such as Australia and the North Island of New Zealand where sunlight exposure is high.,0
Reports from lower-risk groups have indicated that vitamin D deficiency occurs in 25â€“55% of pregnant women [11â€“13].,0
"There are numerous studies which have shown that vitamin D deficiency is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes (Most recent: [14â€“17]), particularly in populations that reside at higher latitudes.",0
"However, studies in women from Australia and New Zealand are less consistent.",0
"Previous studies on pregnant Australian and New Zealand women have reported that while circulating 25(OH)D was significantly lower in women with PE, sPTB, GDM and those who delivered a small-for gestational age (SGA) infant, no association between vitamin D deficiency and these pregnancy complications was found after adjusting for covariates [18â€“20].",0
"Differences in ethnicity [21], solar exposure and geographical location, as well as genetics [22] and supplementation [23â€“25], are known to affect 25(OH)D status and therefore influence study outcomes.",0
"Furthermore, the gestation at which vitamin D was measured is also important.",0
"In the case of preterm delivery, vitamin D status measured closer to the delivery date was more significantly associated with preterm delivery than earlier measures [26].",0
"However, measuring circulating 25(OH)D in early pregnancy is common and potentially clinically useful as this is prior to when many of the pregnancy complications that affect late gestation manifest.",0
"Using a robust, validated chemiluminescent-based assay to measure serum 25(OH)D [27], we aimed to investigate the differences between vitamin D status in early pregnancy in two distinct populations of nulliparous women from Australia and New Zealand.",0
We also aimed to examine the relationship between serum 25(OH)D at 15\u2009Â±\u20091\xa0weeksâ€™ gestation and the risk of an adverse pregnancy outcome and included determining the effect modification of fetal sex on the association between maternal vitamin D status and pregnancy outcome.,0
Visfatin as a predictor for growth of fetus and infant\n\nAbstract\n\nObjective:\nVisfatin is an adipocytokine that functions as an enzyme and a growth factor to investigate the relationship between serum visfatin and the fetusâ€™s anthropometric markers up to a year after birth.,0
"In a separate study on group B, visfatin levels in the first and second trimesters showed a significant negative correlation with infantâ€™s weight.",0
Discussion\nNo study has yet been conducted to assess the relationship between maternal serum visfatin and neonatal anthropometric indicators by categorizing mothers based on BMI.,0
The visfatin regulation mechanism in human fetal blood circulation is unknown(12).,0
"However, recent studies have proposed the presence of a relationship between maternal serum visfatin level and fetal growth.",0
"A strong relationship was found between maternal serum visfatin and neonatal anthropometric indicators in groups A and B, with a possible mechanism of maternal visfatin entering the fetal blood circulation through the placenta as a result of endocrine changes.",0
"Moreover, umbilical cord serum visfatin concentrations were found to have a positive relationship with insulin levels(13).",0
Mazaki-Tovi analyzed the relationship of increased maternal serum visfatin with gestational diabetes mellitus infection and the birth of LGA infants.,0
One of the reasons for a visfatin effect on fetal development is its effect on sirtuins (SIRT).,0
"A significant correlation was observed between the first and second trimesters visfatin level with infantâ€™s height in both groups, such that this relationship was positive in group A and negative in group B.",0
"SIRTs are a class of\xa0proteins\xa0that have a role in cellular processes associated with body metabolism such as cell differentiation, aging,\xa0transcription,\xa0apoptosis,\xa0inflammation,\xa0and stress resistance, as well as energy efficiency and alertness during\xa0low-calorie situations.",0
"SIRT 1 (SIRT1) affects chromatin modulation, and therefore suppresses transcription and interacts with transcription factors, and is capable of positive or negative regulation of gene expression(15).",0
"Through involvement in NAD+synthesis needed for SIRT activity, visfatin has a major role in the regulation of SIRT1-dependent transcription, and this leads to the metabolism of energy and differentiation of stem cells.",0
"This means that Nampt promotes osteocyte differentiation through a pathway mediated by SIRT1(16,17).",0
High levels of SIRT1 expression in the human brain have been revealed(18).,0
"SIRTs have an important role in the process of synapse promotion and modulation of their strength, which is important for memory formation.",0
"During neuronal development, SIRT1 has a important role in promoting xonal elongation, neurite outgrowth, and dendritic branching via several targets and mechanisms(19).",0
The NAD+dependent deacetylase SIRT1 is implicated in energy balance regulation by its effect on pro-opiomelanocortin and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamusthis(20).,0
Obesity is correlated with low NAD+/SIRT pathway expression in adipose tissue of BMI-discordant monozygotic twins(22).,0
"The persistence of the relationship between postpartum maternal serum visfatin levels and anthropometric indicators can be attributed to excretion of visfatin in motherâ€™s milk, which was confirmed by BienertovÃ¡-VaÅ¡kÅ¯ et al.(25).",0
"Based on maternal colostrum visfatin levels, the aurors were able to predict neonatal weight loss in the first three days of birth(25,26).",0
Linear regression analysis revealed that first and second trimester visfatin levels were significant independent predictors of infantâ€™s weight in group B and infantâ€™s height in both groups.,0
"Visfatin by effect on the production of SIRT1, consequently, interference in the development of the brain and energy balance regulation may be associated with head circumferences and weights of fetus and child.",0
"According to these results, visfatin can have a major role in regulating neonatal obesity after birth.",0
The above studies confirm the present study results.,0
"Generally, these results show that visfatin has a major role in maternal-fetal metabolic interaction.",0
"Our results further show different metabolic regulations in groups A and B, which may be due to differences in expression of SIRT1, glucose transfer or insulin resistance as a result of resistance to glucose entry to fetal tissues for unknown reasons, which require further studies.",0
It is likely that visfatin can be used in the future as a biomarker predicting fetal and neonatal growth.,0
Study Limitations\nThis study provides useful data of the relationship between serum visfatin and the childrenâ€™s anthropometric markers up to a year after birth.,0
Second trimester visfatin level was a significant predictor of birth height in group B.,0
"However, the present study has some limitations.",0
"First, we know that it would be better to evaluate levels of cord plasma and breast milk concentrations of visfatin and assess their correlation with the childrenâ€™s anthropometric in order to support our results.",0
"However, we could not do it, which is a limitation of our study.",0
We suggest the long-term fallow up of mothers and infants with more abundant sample.,0
"Conclusion\nAfter a careful review of previous studies on visfatin and pregnancy, we can claim the present study is the first in Iran to have specifically addressed the relationship between maternal visfatin levels and infantâ€™s anthropometric indicators up to a year after birth.",0
"Conclusion:\nMaternal serum visfatin level shows a relationship with fetal and infant anthropometric indicators, with different effects in the two groups, suggesting visfatin dysfunction in the overweight group before pregnancy.",0
Our study can be the basis for further and more precise studies.,0
"In the present study, the relationship between prenatal visfatin level and infantâ€™s anthropometric indicators in the two years following childbirth was assessed.",0
"Serum visfatin level appears to be related to the fetus and infantâ€™s anthropometric indicators (infantâ€™s weight, height and birth height.",0
First and second trimester visfatin levels were significant independent predictors of infantâ€™s weight in group B and infantâ€™s height in both groups.,0
"The second trimester visfatin level was a significant predictor of birth height in group B. Visfatin has extensive effects on pregnancy physiology and pathology, maternal and especially neonatal outcomes, and its effect is different in normal weight and overweight women.",0
"Hence, pre-pregnancy BMI appears to be a determining factor in creating the difference and the amount of maternal plasma visfatin during pregnancy, which can predict maternal serum visfatin and neonatal and maternal outcomes.",0
It is recommended that future studies be conducted with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods.,0
"PRECIS: We measured the serum visfatin level in pregnancy, and assess its relationship with the childrenâ€™s anthropometric markers, to determine if it can be used as biomarker.",0
"Introduction\nBy releasing adipokines, adipose tissue has a major role in fertility, and physical and sexual maturation(1).",0
"Visfatin, a new 52KDa adipokine(2), was renamed to nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (Nampt) in 2002 after it was shown that it encodes an enzyme called Nampt, which is involved in the conversion of nicotinamide into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)(3).",0
"Yet, visfatinâ€™s regulatory and release mechanisms in the fetus and neonate are still unclear(5).",0
"It is probably regulated by glucose and insulin(6), and increases with gradual degradation of B-cell and progress of insulin-resistance and maternal weight(7).",0
Many studies have shown that increased visfatin levels in maternal plasma are associated with small-for-gestantional-age births(8)and intrauterine growth restriction(9).,0
"Strong relationships have recently been reported between serum visfatin levels in the first trimester of pregnancy and insulin secretion in the fetus and final birth weight, which shows the role of visfatin secretion in early pregnancy in the later metabolic modeling of the fetus(11).",0
These results suggest that visfatin may play an important role in maternal-fetal metabolic interaction.,0
"However, due to the lack of sufficient information about the physiologic role of visfatin in adults, its source and regulation mechanism in fetal and neonatal stages cannot be argued absolutely.",0
"In group A, there was a strong positive relationship between birth head circumference and the first (p1=0.054, r1=0.580) and second trimester visfatin levels (p2=0.051, r2=0.530).",0
"To investigate the role of visfatin in the growth of the fetus and up to a year after birth, we measured serum visfatin levels during 6-12 and 15-20 weeks of gestation in an Iranian population.",0
"The relationship between visfatin level and neonatal anthropometric indicators at birth\nIn group A, a strong positive relationship was observed between birth head circumference and the first (p1=0.05, r1=0.580) and second trimester visfatin levels (p2=0.051, r2=0.530).",0
"Spearman Rank correlation test showed a negative significant relationship between second trimester visfatin level and birth height (p=0.015, r=-0.523) in group B (Table 2).",0
Linear regression analysis revealed that the second trimester visfatin level was a significant predictor of birth height in group B (Table 3).,0
"In group B, second trimester visfatin levels correlated negatively with birth length (p=0.015, r=-0.523) and infantâ€™s head circumference (p2=0.050, r2=-0.392).",0
"Significant correlations were observed in both groups between first trimester visfatin (pa=0.002, ra=0.713, pb=0.005, rb=-0.540, in A and B group, respectively) and second trimester visfatin (pa=0.009, ra=0.628 and pb=0.008, rb=-0.518, in groups A and B, respectively) with infantâ€™s height.",0
This correlation was positive in group A and negative in group B.,0
"According to the Lambda test, this correlation was significantly greater in group A than in group B (p<0.05).",0
"A negative and significant correlation was separately found between infantâ€™s weight and the first (p1=0.024, r1=-0.450) and second trimester visfatin levels (p2=0.005, r2=-0.540) in group B.",0
"Generally, the relationship between visfatin and the infantsâ€™s growth indicators was positive in group A and negative in group B.",0
"A strong negative correlation was separately found between the second trimester visfatin level and infantâ€™s head circumference (p2=0.05, r2=-0.392) in group B (Table 2).",0
Linear regression analysis revealed that first and second trimester visfatin levels were significant predictors of infantâ€™s weight in group B and infantâ€™s height in both groups (Table 3).,0
A community-based cluster randomised controlled trial in rural Bangladesh to evaluate the impact of the use of iron-folic acid supplements early in pregnancy on the risk of neonatal mortality: the Shonjibon trial\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nIron-deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency globally.,0
"However, most of the evidence is from observational epidemiological studies except for a very few randomised controlled trials.",0
"We also hypothesised that the early start to IFA supplements would not increase iron-related side effects, e.g.",0
nausea & vomiting in intervention clusters and will be cost-effective in reducing neonatal mortality in intervention clusters.,0
"We will also exclude three Upazilas from Gazipur because of the high number of garment industries, which would have high numbers of working women and would be difficult to follow-up and eight Upazilas from Mymensingh because of the high prevalence of malaria and kalazar.",0
"We will exclude areas where access is extremely difficult, for example in flood-prone areas.",0
The findings of the formative study suggested that introduction of IFA supplements early in pregnancy is feasible with support from BRAC or government community health workers.,0
"The formative study also suggested to include culturally sensitive reasons for the use of IFA supplements during pregnancy, improvement of the community health-worker training modules and to standardise messages across all health workers.",0
"Assuming a crude birth rate of 23 per 1000 people, 10% loss of pregnancies before birth and 15% loss to follow up each cluster will yield 300 births over 15\xa0months, and this will be sufficient to reach the desired sample size.",0
IFA supplements have also been found to reduce the preterm delivery rate and neonatal mortality attributable to prematurity and birth asphyxia.,0
The models will evaluate the impact of the interventions over time by testing for an interaction between time and intervention group.,0
"We will conduct analyses to identify the subgroups (based on household wealth, sex of infant and maternal education) that modify the response to the intervention.",0
These results combined indicate that IFA supplements in populations of iron-deficient pregnant women could lead to a decrease in the number of neonatal deaths mediated by reduced rates of preterm delivery.,0
"Discussion\nIron deficiency is associated with increased risk of maternal death, preterm delivery, impaired foetal growth and development, low birth weight, increased neonatal mortality and impaired infant development [17].",0
"Although the importance of IFA supplements to prevent maternal anaemia and mortality is widely accepted, most antenatal IFA supplements distribution programs are of low priority.",0
"Evaluations of these programs using maternal anaemia as the outcome report little or no impact because of the multiple causes of maternal anaemia, low compliance, and inadequate distribution programs.",0
"Recent surveys in Bangladesh indicate that only 52% of rural women reported any use of IFA supplements in their last pregnancy, but this falls to 39% for the poorest households, and to 34% for women with no education [5].",0
"In the Projahnmo trial conducted in rural Bangladesh, only 40% of women in the baseline surveys reported any use of IFA supplements in pregnancy [18].",0
"Access to IFA supplements is through antenatal care, however, in rural Bangladesh, the median gestation that women commence antenatal care is 5.2\xa0months, and 44% of women report no use of antenatal care [5].",0
"Although they did not start early, these figures indicate there is a substantial opportunity to improve IFA supplements distribution in rural Bangladesh.",0
There is limited evidence about the optimal timing of IFA supplementation in pregnancy.,0
"In this paper, we describe the protocol of a community-based cluster randomised controlled trial that aims to evaluate the impact of maternal antenatal IFA supplements on perinatal outcomes.",0
Promising evidence came from a trial in China investigating the effects of IFA supplements in pregnancy on neonatal deaths [19].,0
"However, the neonatal mortality analyses were post-hoc analyses, and the sample size was small resulting in poor precision in the effect estimates, and reduced power to explore all the factors modifying the effects on neonatal mortality.",0
"Thus, the impact of early IFA supplements on neonatal mortality needs confirmation in a larger scale trial.",0
"This project will determine if antenatal IFA supplements commenced in the first trimester of pregnancy, rather than later, will significantly reduce neonatal deaths in the first month of life, and if this approach is cost-effective.",0
"It will also provide valuable evidence about the role of groundwater iron level in modifying the responses of antenatal IFA supplements on neonatal mortality since there is already some evidence which suggests a positive, dose-response association between natural iron in groundwater and the iron status of women [6].",0
"Methods/design\nThe effect of the early use of iron-folic acid supplements on neonatal mortality will be examined using a community based, cluster randomised controlled trial in five districts with 30,000 live births.",0
Discussion\nThis paper aims to describe the study protocol of a community based randomised controlled trial evaluating the impact of the use of iron-folic acid supplements early in pregnancy on the risk of neonatal mortality.,0
"This study is critical because it will determine if antenatal IFA supplements commenced in the first trimester of pregnancy, rather than later, will significantly reduce neonatal deaths in the first month of life, and if this approach is cost-effective.",0
"Due to the high iron requirements for pregnancy, it is highly prevalent and severe in pregnant women.",0
Effective interventions directed specifically at preventing neonatal deaths are required to improve overall child survival.,0
"A systematic review in 2005 found that up to 70% of neonatal deaths, worldwide, could be averted by implementing sixteen evidence-based interventions at near universal coverage (99%) that incorporated preconception, antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal interventions [3].",0
"However, this review did not include antenatal iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation for pregnant women.",0
"At that time no trials had reported the effects of IFA on neonatal mortality, although these supplements were known to benefit both maternal and infant health [3].",0
"Due to the high iron requirements for pregnancy, it is highly prevalent and severe in pregnant women [4].",0
"The first national micronutrients status survey, published in early 2013, reported that iron deficiency among non-pregnant non-lactating women was 7.1%.",0
The survey findings also suggest a positive association between natural iron content in groundwater and iron status of women [6].,0
There is strong evidence that maternal iron deficiency anaemia increases the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes.,0
IFA supplements have also been found to reduce the preterm delivery rate and neonatal mortality attributable to prematurity and birth asphyxia [7].,0
"Other studies from low-income countries have reported that preterm delivery is one of the main contributors to neonatal deaths [12,13].",0
We thus propose a large-scale prospective trial to measure the impact of the early introduction of antenatal iron/folic acid supplementation in pregnancy on neonatal outcomes in rural Bangladesh.,0
We didnâ€™t consider placebo because WHO and Government of Bangladesh have a recommendation that pregnant women should receive 60\xa0mg of iron supplementation.,0
But the implementation of this recommendation is inadequate.,0
"Surveys indicate that only 52% of rural women reported any use of iron/folic acid in their last pregnancy but this dropped to 39% for the poorest households, and to 34% for women with no education (3).",0
"Objectives and hypothesis\nThe trial objectives are to evaluate the effect of early availability and promotion of IFA supplements on neonatal mortality, low birthweight and preterm delivery.",0
"The primary hypothesis is that in a community-based, cluster randomized controlled trial of women from rural Bangladesh, daily supplementation with 60\xa0mg elemental iron and 400\xa0Î¼g folic acid starting in the first trimester of pregnancy, and sustained for at least 180\xa0days, will reduce neonatal mortality by 25% from 33/1000 to 24.8/1000 live births compared to usual iron-folic acid supplementation programs.",0
"The secondary hypotheses are that the early availability and promotion of IFA supplements in intervention clusters will reduce preterm delivery by 30% (15% in control to 10.5% in intervention), and low birth weight by 30% (15% in control to 10.5% in intervention).",0
"We further hypothesised that household wealth and maternal education would modify the neonatal mortality responses with a greater reduction for women from the poorest households, and women with no education.",0
Maternal diet during pregnancy is related with the infant stool microbiome in a delivery mode-dependent manner\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground\nThe gut microbiome has an important role in infant health and immune development and may be affected by early-life exposures.,0

Fish consumption is generally recommended as healthful due to its DHA and EPA content despite the exposure to heavy metals and other contaminants that may be detrimental to health [12].,0
"For instance, greater fish consumption is associated with child development outcomes including decreased risk of asthma and improved cognition [13,14].",0
The decrease in OTUs classified to the species Clostridium neonatale with increased maternal fish and seafood intake in infants born by Cesarean section is a possibly beneficial change to infant intestinal microbial communities.,0
We observed consistent associations between maternal DHA and EPA intake and infant gut microbiota.,0
"The associations of other maternal dietary factors with specific infant gut microbes were also somewhat unexpected, namely for red and processed meat and for fruit consumption.",0
"While fruit is considered healthful and red and processed meat consumption is recommended to be limited, OTUs in the genus Bifidobacterium , generally recognized as a beneficial microbe, were decreased with increasing maternal fruit consumption in vaginally born infants yet increased with higher maternal red and processed meat consumption in those born by Cesarean section.",0
"Maternal dairy intake was associated with an increased odds of infants belonging to the high Clostridium cluster in infants born by Cesarean section (OR (95% CI)\u2009=\u20092.36 (1.05, 5.30)).",0
The results from infant gut microbiome cluster analyses are consistent with this observation.,0
"For example, it is surprising that higher maternal fruit intake is associated with an increased probability of an infant delivered vaginally belonging to cluster 2, in which the genera Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides are underrepresented and the family Clostridiaceae is overrepresented compared to the other two clusters.",0
The effect of maternal dairy intake on infant gut microbiota was primarily observed in infants delivered by Cesarean section.,0
"One recent study suggests that both the microbial and fatty acid composition of breast milk may differ by delivery mode [18], so the differential effect of maternal dairy intake by delivery mode on the infant gut microbiome may be attributable to the differences in breast milk microbiota or lipids in relation to maternal diet by delivery mode.",0
Linear models suggested additional associations between maternal diet and infant intestinal microbes in both delivery mode strata.,0
"Our observation of increased colonization with the species Acinetobacter rhizosphaerae , a microbe that colonizes and promotes growth in plants [19], with maternal dairy in the Cesarean group is interesting in conjunction with the positive associations found between maternal dairy and the species Clostridium neonatale and Staphylococcus genus in vaginally delivered infants.",0
"Species of the genus Acinetobacter are increasingly involved in nosocomial infections [20], while the species Clostridium neonatale was initially isolated from infants affected by necrotizing enterocolitis [21], and the pathogenic potential of species in the genus Staphylococcus is well-established [22,23].",0
"Thus, it will be important to investigate whether maternal dairy consumption fosters the growth of potentially pathogenic microbes in the infant gut, particularly for infants delivered operatively.",0
"In several cases, a maternal dietary factor was associated with a microbe in both delivery groups but in opposite directions.",0
"Since Cesarean delivery results in differential microbial community structure of the infant gut [24], and the gut microbiome is a complex system, such differences are plausible; experimental studies will be required to confirm this observation.",0
"However, the associations between maternal diet and infant gut microbial communities did not always differ by delivery mode.",0
"For example, the maternal aMED score was consistently positively and negatively associated with the Enterobacteriaceae family, and additionally negatively associated with the species Escherichia coli , in both delivery mode strata.",0
"Our study sample was drawn from Northern New England, which has a relatively homogenous population; this could limit the generalizability of the study.",0
"However, by limiting unmeasured confounding due to differences in human microbiomes between populations that may result in erroneous associations with dietary differences, our study also may have greater internal validity.",0
"Maternal diet was assessed by self-report between 24 and 28\xa0weeks of gestation, and it is possible that dietary patterns change near the end of pregnancy or during lactation.",0
Conclusions\nOur data indicate that maternal diet influences the infant gut microbiome and that these effects differ by delivery mode.,0
"However, diets are often stable, and a mid-pregnancy food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)-assessment is likely to be sufficiently representative of late pregnancy and lactation diet in a high proportion of individuals [25,26].",0
"Nonetheless, the effects we observe may be due in part to maternal diet during lactation.",0
"Further, we cannot conclude if the effects of maternal diet occur only in breastfed babies, or also in those mostly fed formula, or a combination of formula and breast milk.",0
Little is known about the actual mechanisms by which maternal diet affects childrenâ€™s health; we hypothesize that maternal diet impacts the development of the gut microbiome in infancy and subsequently influences child health outcomes.,0
"To assess the relationship between maternal dietary factors and infant gut cluster membership, we used multinomial logistic regression with cluster 1 as the reference group.",0
"To more precisely identify which microbial taxa contribute to the observed differences in infant stool microbial community composition by maternal dietary factors, we used a series of linear models to test the relationships between each maternal dietary factor and each OTU.",0
We were unable to adjust for antibiotic usage due to a paucity of exposure and imprecise data on timing of exposure.,0
It is also possible that associations between maternal exposures and infant microbiota at 6\xa0weeks of life are influenced by factors not investigated in this study.,0
"Future studies examining the relationship between maternal diet and components of breast milk including microbial and nutritional profiles, as well as the potential influence of maternal diet on the fetal microbiome, may offer insight into the mechanisms by which maternal diet influences the infant gut microbiome.",0
Determining the impact of changes in the gut microbiome of infants due to maternal diet on infant health and development is an opportunity to refine dietary recommendations for pregnant and lactating women to support infant health.,0
"Conclusions\nIn conclusion, we identified three clusters of infant gut microbial communities and observed effects of multiple maternal prenatal dietary factors on the infant gut microbiome that often varied by delivery mode.",0
"Background\nStudies have examined the maternal contribution to infant health, including the effect of maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation.",0
"In preliminary analyses of all infants, delivery mode, feeding method, as previously shown in our cohort [24], and parity were significantly related to infant stool microbial community composition at 6\xa0weeks of age.",0
Adjusted analyses included both variables known to be related to the infant gut microbiome by previous studies and variables significantly related to infant gut microbiota in our population to control confounding.,0
"To assess the relationship between each maternal dietary factor and infant gut microbiome cluster membership, we used multinomial logistic regression in the R package nnet adjusting all models for the same covariates as in previous analyses.",0
All analyses were analogously performed in the Cesarean section group to assess if an effect of maternal diet on the infant gut microbiome exists in the case of surgical delivery.,0
Prenatal diet influences the risk of infant and child allergy.,0
"For instance, the Mediterranean diet during pregnancy has been associated with a reduced risk of both persistent and atopic wheeze and atopy in children at 6.5\xa0years old [1,2].",0
"High meat consumption during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of wheeze in the first year of life, while maternal dairy intake is associated with a reduced risk of infantile wheeze [2].",0
It is established that diet is an important driver of the gut microbiome.,0
Short-term diets comprised solely of either plant or animal foods have been shown to alter the human gut microbiome [3].,0
"To date, there has been limited investigation of the relation of maternal diet with the developing infant gut microbiome.",0
One study observed that maternal high-fat diet during pregnancy was associated with meconium microbial composition but had limited maternal diet data [6].,0
One mechanism the infant gut microbiome may be affected by maternal diet is via vertical transfer of maternal microbes to infants at delivery.,0
"There is a well-established relation of the infant gut microbiome with delivery mode (Cesarean section versus vaginally born infants) [7,8] which may persist through adulthood [9].",0
"Alternatively, maternal diet may affect fetal development and subsequent host response to microbial populations at and after birth.",0
"Additionally, differences in breast milk composition due to maternal diet may contribute to the infant gut microbiome in breastfed infants.",0
We examined the relationship of maternal diet during pregnancy with the infant stool microbiome in 6-week-old infants and identified associations within delivery mode groups.,0
"Adjusting for infant feeding method, maternal BMI, parity, and batch, maternal fruit consumption was associated with infant stool microbiome composition (generalized UniFrac distance PERMANOVA, p \u2009=\u20090.028; Table\xa02; Fig.",0
"In a sensitivity analysis, the effect of maternal fruit consumption on the infant gut microbiome in babies born vaginally persisted when restricted to infants who were exclusively breastfed (generalized UniFrac distance PERMANOVA, p \u2009=\u20090.022; Table\xa02 ) .",0

"Genetic, management, and nutritional factors affecting intramuscular fat deposition in beef cattle â€” A review\n\nAbstract\nIntramuscular fat (IMF) content in skeletal muscle including the longissimus dorsi muscle (LM), also known as marbling fat, is one of the most important factors determining beef quality in several countries including Korea, Japan, Australia, and the United States.",0
Cattle management factors are also important for IMF deposition.,0
"Following weaning, steers were grown with a forage-only system and forage with high-energy supplemented system to test effects of a high-energy grain-based substitution on fat deposition with 5 times serial slaughter.",0
"In their study, genotype differences were generally observed in IMF contents of 4 muscles ( biceps femoris , supraspinatus , semitendinosus , longissimus lumborum , and infraspinatus ), although semitendinosus muscle IMF did not differ among genotypes.",0
"Thus, the dietary vitamin C requirement for beef cattle is not specified in the NRC [146].",0
"Additional studies are warranted to produce beef with appropriate levels of IMF deposition to satisfy beef quality and taste, support human health, and sustain the animal industry, depending on the situation of each country.",0
"However, substitution of equivalent amount of energy from grazed pasture with high-energy grain-based feed has not increased IMF contents.",0
"Selecting a sire is important for high-quality beef production; animals with high genetic potential will generally exhibit higher MS at slaughter age, whereas animals with low genetic potential will give low MS [50].",0
"MANAGEMENT FACTORS\nSeveral management factors, including weaning age, castration, slaughter age and weight, nutrition and other environmental conditions can affect IMF deposition.",0
"The effects of several management factors, including weaning age, castration, slaughter weight and age, and environmental conditions on IMF deposition are also reviewed.",0
Weaning age\nWeaning age is known to affect IMF deposition and MS in beef.,0
Several studies have reported that early weaning or early weaning combined with a high-grain diet increases IMF deposition in beef cattle.,0
Effect of weaning age has been studied in Shorthorn calves [52].,0
"However, weaning treatment did not affect feed efficiency, post weaning growth, MS, and other carcass traits.",0
"In the Angus study, early weaning at 105 d of age and high concentrate feeding for 148 d followed by grazing and feedlot entry increased both the MS and hot carcass weight (HCW) compared with normal weaning at 253 d of age (normally weaned calves stayed with their dams to graze on pasture), although feedlot performance remained unchanged [54].",0
The authors suggested that metabolic imprinting by early weaning and a high concentrate feeding before grazing is a feasible method to improve MS and carcass weight.,0
A molecular study revealed that early weaning and a high-starch diet activated precocious pre-adipocyte differentiation and fat accumulation by activating adipogenic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARG) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein Î± pathways.,0
"Smith and Johnson [57] suggested that the glucose contribution to fat synthesis decreases as cattle become fatter, whereas acetate use increases, especially in the IMF area.",0
"Nutritional factors, including fat metabolism, digestion and absorption of feed, glucose/starch availability, and vitamin A, D, and C levels are important for IMF deposition.",0
"Those authors also suggested that providing dietary glucose sources (e.g., high-starch diet) at an early age can improve IMF deposition.",0
The authors suggested that feeding concentrate plus roughage or starch after early weaning at a young age could alter adipogenic and lipogenic potential in loin meat.,0
"Castration\nCastration of bulls generally increases IMF content in several cattle breeds, although it reduces growth rate [40].",0
"A 2016 report of nationwide pooled data in Korean cattle revealed that the majority (76%) of bulls had a QG 3, whereas 85.5% of castrated cattle showed grades of QG 1 or higher (QG1, QG1+, and QG1++) ([59];Figure 2).",0
"However, these changes with slaugther age were not observed in double-muscled Belgian Blue bulls [24].",0
Manipulating IMF deposition through developmental programming via metabolic imprinting is a recently proposed nutritional method to change potential IMF deposition during the fetal and neonatal periods in rodents and domestic animals.,0
The MS generally increases with slaughter age in Korean cattle.,0
This study suggested that changes in MS with slaughter age vary among farms.,0
"The difference may be due to genetic factors, management, or feed.",0
Decreasing slaughter age may be better for reducing production costs when feed prices are high.,0
"Pethick et al [69] suggested that a prolonged feeding period gives the cattle time to obtain high IMF levels because time is needed for muscle to reach maturity, followed by time for the muscle to fill up with IMF.",0
"However, feed efficiency decreases as animals age due to a decrease in the rate of muscle growth [70].",0
"Thus, animals with low genetic potential for QG are not recommended for a long fattening stage, which would result in low feed efficiency.",0
"In addition, a long fattening period could result in low yield grade (YG) because long-term fattening increases backfat thickness and carcass weight, which negatively affect YG in Korean cattle [59].",0
"Slaughter age needs to be optimised to get maximum profits for farmers by monitoring the QG and quantity grade of carcasses, feed costs, and carcass prices (auction prices).",0
Slaughter weight\nIMF content or MS generally increases with slaughter weight in several cattle breeds.,0
The National Beef Quality Audit of the USA (beef of steers and heifers in 28 packing plants during Octoberâ€“December 1991) found that MS increased with increasing slaugher weight from 173 to over 543 kg [71].,0
"Several factors, including MS or QG, feed costs, and carcass prices need to be considered to determine the optimum slaughter weight for the maximum profit.",0
"Environments\nStudies have demonstrated that environmental conditions, such as temperature stress, can negatively affect animal growth and beef quality in cattle [74].",0
Our recent study indicated that a lower ambient temperature decreased growth and feed efficiency in Korean cattle steers [78].,0
"Heat stress can also negatively affect animal performance, including growth, milk production, reproduction, feed intake, overall health, and well-being in cattle [79,80].",0
The coordination of several factors affects IMF deposition.,0
"The authors suggested that mild heat stress in summer and mild cold stress in winter may be beneficial to fat deposition under ad libitum feeding conditions for cattle fed in an unprotected, unsheltered area.",0
They also suggested that animals deposit fat in the winter to provide insulation for the body under cold stress.,0
Animals may require more energy to meet the increased maintenance energy requirements.,0
"Young [81] suggested that energy requirements increase during winter or when animals are under cold stress, as increased heat production is needed to maintain body temperature by shivering or other thermogenic process.",0
Angus crossbred cattle exposed to greater heat stress tend to have a greater MS [82].,0
The authors mentioned that slight heat stress might induce IMF deposition.,0
Seasonal variations in carcass characteristics have been observed in Korean cattle steers by our group [2].,0
"Therefore, the poor YG in winter may be due, in part, to high backfat thickness.",0
"Thus, a combination of several strategies may be needed to manipulate IMF deposition, depending on the consumerâ€™s beef preference.",0
"However, both MS and QG were best in autumn and worst in spring.",0
Maternal dietary risk factors in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (United States).,1
Cancer Causes Control 15(6):559â€“570.,1
"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer (with 2,400 cases diagnosed each year in those under age 20) and the second most common cause of mortality in children aged 1â€“14.",1
"The NCCLS is a population-based caseâ€“control study of risk factors for child leukemia, including maternal diet.",1
Researchers compared 138 mothers of children diagnosed with ALL with a control group of 138 mothers whose children did not have cancer.,1
All the mothers completed a questionnaire pertaining to their diet in the 12 months prior to pregnancy.,1
"The researchers chose this period as a more accurate reflection of each womanâ€™s typical diet, compared to pregnancy, when diet can vary with the degree of nausea experienced.",1
"The questionnaire asked about 76 food items, plus use of vitamins, certain reduced-fat foods, and cooking fat.",1
"The researchers found that the more vegetables, fruits, and proteins a woman ate, the lower the risk of her child having leukemia.",1
Use of vitamin supplements was not significantly linked to leukemia risk.,1

"The greatest risk reduction was among children diagnosed under 5 years of age whose mothers used supplements during all three trimesters (OR 0.5, CI 0.3-0.8).",1
This effect did not vary by histology and was seen for supplementation during pregnancy rather than during the month before pregnancy or while breast feeding.,1
"The proportion of control mothers who took vitamins during pregnancy varied tremendously: from 3% in Israel and France, 21% in Italy, 33% in Canada, 52% in Spain and 86 to 92% at the three U.S. centers.",1
"The composition of the various multivitamin compounds taken also varied: the daily dose of vitamin C ranged from 0 to 600 mg, vitamin E ranged from 0 to 70 mg, vitamin A ranged from 0 to 30,000 IU, and folate ranged from 0 to 2000 micrograms.",1

Half took 60 mg of iron as ferrous sulfate with 200 Î¼g of folic acid and 1 Î¼g of vitamin B12once a day; the others took double this dose once a week.,1
The researchers checked the womenâ€™s levels of hemoglobin (which transports oxygen) and ferritin every four weeks through the end of pregnancy.,1
More of the women taking the weekly dose were mildly anemic (with hemoglobin levels shown not to carry any risk for mothers and infants) compared with the women taking the daily dose.,1
"However, by weeks 28 to 36, women taking the daily supplement had a significantly higher prevalence of hemoconcentration, a condition defined as hemoglobin levels above 145 g/L.",1

Results\nWe identified 637 spots in DVD deplete samples and 655 spots in Control samples (seeFigure 1for a representative gel).,1
"These spots were matched, normalized and quantified.",1
"For each animal, two gels were averaged.",1
"There were 35 spots that were significantly altered between the two groups, 22 were down - regulated and 13 up-regulated (Table 1).",1
These spots were mapped to 33 unique proteins.,1
"The fold changes were uniformly small, with the largest FC being âˆ’1.67 (MEPD).",1
Over half (27 of 49) of the significantly dysregulated spots that were identified as a known protein had a fold change of less than 1.3.,1

Defective Spermatogenesis: Martin et al.,1
The primary objective of a quantitative meta-analysis is to combine the results of previous studies examining a specific research question to arrive at a summary conclusion about a body of research.,1

The method also requires that included studies report a measure of association such as a risk ratio or odds ratio.,1

The management of gestational diabetes\n\nAbstract\nThe incidence of gestational diabetes is increasing.,1
"The incidence of GDM is increasing, in parallel to the increase in type 2 diabetes.",1
"During pregnancy, an increase in insulin resistance occurs.",1
Euglycemia is maintained through a compensatory increase in insulin secretion.,1
"Additionally, the diagnosis of GDM indicates that the mother has a predisposition to diabetes.",1
"In most cases, this is type 2 diabetes.",1
In the longest follow-up of women who have had GDM 36% of women had developed diabetes within 22â€“28 years (by WHO criteria).21This was in a predominantly white population in Boston from the 1960s.,1
Therefore it is commonplace for the diabetes care team to provide the women with information and education to facilitate self-care.,1
"This includes information regarding GDM, self-monitoring of blood glucose, dietary counseling, and advice regarding healthy lifestyle measures post-partum.",1
Blood glucose levels are usually monitored in the fasting state and 1â€“2 hours after meals.,1
"The initial intervention usually entails dietary advice, individualized if possible, and given by a dietitian.",1
This usually means the commencement of insulin.,1
"When the fetal abdominal circumference was <70th percentile, a higher glucose threshold for initiating insulin therapy did not result in an increase in fetal morbidity or macrosomia.26This protocol allowed more women to avoid insulin therapy.",1
Recommendations are individualized after a dietary assessment of each patient.,1
"A secondary aim is to prevent excessive maternal weight gain, particularly in women who are overweight or have gained excess weight in pregnancy.",1
There were no differences in neonatal outcomes.,1
"A basal-bolus regimen of insulin gives the most effective glucose control, and produces better fetal outcomes than a twice daily regime.34Prandial fast-acting insulin is administered to control post-prandial hyperglycemia, and bedtime basal insulin is given if there is fasting hyperglycemia.",1
"Towards the end of the pregnancy, insulin requirements can drop.",1
"With respect to GDM, there have been several small randomized studies comparing the use of rapid acting insulin analogues with regular insulin.",1
"Long-acting insulin analogs, particularly glargine, are increasingly being used in women with type 1 diabetes, and they are often continued through the pregnancy.",1
"No differences in large for gestational age, macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, admission to neonatal intensive care, or fetal anomalies were observed.",1
The incidence of maternal hypoglycemia was lower in the glyburide group (2% vs 20%).,1
"The MiG Study randomized 751 women with GDM to treatment with insulin or metformin.72The women in the metformin arm were treated with supplemental insulin if the maximal dose of metformin, 2500 mg daily, failed to meet the glucose targets.",1
"The primary outcome variable was a composite of neonatal hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, need for phototherapy, birth trauma, Apgar score less than 7, or prematurity.",1
"There was no difference in the primary outcome between the two groups (metformin 116 [32%] events, insulin 119 events [32.2%], RR 1.0 [0.9â€“1.1], p = 0.95).",1
"The incidence of large for gestational age was 10.5%, compared to 3.7% for insulin and 25% for glyburide (p = 0.07).",1
"The rate of neonatal hypoglycemia (5.3%) was similar to insulin (3.7%), but lower than glyburide (33%) (p = 0.006).",1
These subjects had a fasting glucose up to 7.7 mmol/dl and a 2 hour level between 7.8 mmol/L and 11.1 mmol/dl.,1
"They were randomized to receive treatment for GDM, including dietary advice, blood glucose monitoring, and insulin as required, or standard pregnancy care.",1
Those receiving standard care were unaware that they had GDM.,1
"In the treatment group, the aim was to maintain a fasting glucose level of <5.5 mmol/L, and 2 hour post-prandial reading <7.0 mmol/L.",1
"With this, there was a 1% incidence of serious perinatal outcomes (death, shoulder dystocia, fracture, and nerve palsy) compared to 4% amongst women provided with standard pregnancy care only (adjusted risk reduction 0.33, p = 0.01).",1
"Fewer neonates in the treatment group were large for gestational age, and there was no difference in the incidence of small for gestational age infants.",1
There was no difference in the rate of cesarean section.,1
"Preeclampsia occurred less frequently in the intervention group (12% vs 18%, adjusted risk reduction 0.7, p = 0.02).",1
"Because of changes in the diagnostic criteria for GDM over the years, Beischer (1996) was able to examine perinatal mortality amongst women who would have been diagnosed as having GDM by contemporary criteria, but were not considered to have GDM at the time, and were therefore untreated.",1
"The perinatal mortality rate was 2.6% in these women with â€˜mild GDMâ€™ in the 1970s, compared to 0.7%, in the 1980s after routine treatment had been introduced for this group.",1
Their perinatal mortality rate was 2.3 times that of women with normal glucose tolerance.,1
"In the 1980s, with routine treatment for women with mild GDM, their outcomes were not different to women with normal glucose tolerance.",1
"These include a restriction in fat and simple carbohydrate intake, regular distribution of meals, carbohydrate foods favoring those with low glycemic index, and caloric restriction for those who are obese.",1

"Dietary patterns have shifted from a prudent diet (high fruit and vegetable-, and omega-3 fatty acid intake; low omega-6 fatty acid intake) to a western-style diet (higher levels omega-6 fats, lower amounts of fresh fruits and vegetables, and omega-3 fats).",1

Implications for research and practice are also discussed.,1
PubMed Central:,1
"Methods\nA cohort of 1,290 women was interviewed during early pregnancy.",1
We collected information about sleep duration and snoring during early pregnancy.,1
Results from screening and diagnostic testing for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) were abstracted from medical records.,1
"Generalized linear models were fitted to derive relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of GDM associated with sleep duration and snoring, respectively.",1
"Results\nAfter adjusting for maternal age and race/ethnicity, GDM risk was increased among women sleeping â‰¤ 4 hours compared with those sleeping 9 hours per night (RR = 5.56; 95% CI 1.31-23.69).",1
The corresponding RR for lean women (<25 kg/m2) was 3.23 (95% CI 0.34-30.41) and 9.83 (95% CI 1.12-86.32) for overweight women (â‰¥ 25 kg/m2).,1
The risk of GDM was particularly elevated among overweight women who snored.,1
"Compared with lean women who did not snore, those who were overweight and snored had a 6.9-fold increased risk of GDM (95% CI 2.87-16.6).",1
We analyzed maternal plasma glucose concentrations 1 hour after a 50-gram oral glucose challenge as part of routine mid-pregnancy screening for GDM.,1
"Eligible women initiated prenatal care before 20 weeks gestation, were 18 years of age or older, could speak and read English, and planned to carry the pregnancy to term and to deliver at either hospital.",1
"At 14 weeks gestation, on average, participants reported sociodemographic, behavioral, and health characteristics in a structured interview.",1
"[""After delivery, study personnel abstracted data from participants' hospital labor and delivery medical records and clinic records.""]",1
"Between December 2003 and July 2006, 1,393 (82%) of 1,685 approached women consented to participate.",1
"We sequentially excluded 12 women with early pregnancy losses, 52 who were lost to follow-up, and 23 who did not complete the interview.",1
We also excluded 16 women with pre-gestational diabetes.,1
"Thus, 1,290 women remained for analysis.",1
All study procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Swedish Medical Center.,1
All participants provided written informed consent.,1
"Description of covariates\nAt the time of enrollment in the study, a 45 to 60-minute structured questionnaire was administered by a trained interviewer.",1
Information on medical and reproductive histories and sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics including average number of hours of sleep before and during early pregnancy was collected.,1
"Maternal average nightly sleep duration during pregnancy was ascertained by asking women the following question: ""Since becoming pregnant, how many hours per night do you sleep?""",1
A similar question was asked for sleep duration before pregnancy.,1
Responses were recorded as integers.,1
"For bivariate analyses, we classified participants into 4 sleep duration categories: â‰¤ 4, 5-8, 9, and â‰¥ 10 hours, respectively.",1
"The cut-points were based on categorizations used in prior research [4,11].",1
Sleep disordered breathing during pregnancy was assessed by asking women about the frequency of snoring during the index pregnancy.,1
"Specifically they were asked ""Since becoming pregnant, when you are asleep, to the best of your knowledge, have you snored?""",1
"Responses were as follows: ( i ) all of the time, ( ii ) most of the time, ( iii ) some of the time, ( iv ) a little of the time, and ( v ) none of the time.",1
"From this information, we categorized participants as snoring if their reported snoring most or all of the time; all other women were classified as non-snorers.",1
Pre-pregnancy weight and height were also based on self-reports made during the interview.,1
Pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.,1
"In our study setting, according to the recommendations from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) [25], all pregnant women were screened at 24-28 weeks gestation using a 50 gram 1-hour oral glucose challenge test.",1
"Those patients who failed this screening test (glucose â‰¥ 140 mg/dl) were then followed-up within 1-2 weeks with a 100 gram, 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).",1
"[""We abstracted laboratory results from participants' 50 gram 1-hour glucose challenge test and from the diagnostic 100 gram 3-hour OGTT.""]",1
Women were diagnosed with GDM if two or more of the 100 gram OGTT glucose levels exceeded the ADA criteria [28] as follows: fasting â‰¥ 95 mg/dl; 1-hour â‰¥ 180 mg/dl; 2-hour â‰¥ 155 mg/dl; 3-hour â‰¥ 140 mg/dl.,1
"Statistical analytical methods\nWe compared the frequency distribution of sociodemographic, lifestyle, behavioral and medical history characteristics of participants according to GDM diagnosis status.",1
We assessed glucose intolerance by analyzing results of the 1-hour oral glucose screening test results.,1
Linear regression procedures were used to estimate maternal mean 1-hour glucose concentrations while adjusting for confounding by maternal age and race/ethnicity.,1
"We fitted generalized linear models, using a log-link function, to derive relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) [29,30] of the associations between sleep duration and snoring variables with glucose intolerance and GDM risk.",1
Separate models were fitted for sleep duration and snoring.,1
We then controlled for potential confounders that changed multivariable RRs by more than 10% relative to the unadjusted RR [31].,1
"On the basis of these criteria, we controlled for maternal age and race/ethnicity.",1
None of the other variables listed in Table1were found to be confounders.,1
Gestational age at enrollment or interview was not a confounder in this study.,1
"Therefore, we constructed additional models that simultaneously adjusted for pre-pregnancy BMI.",1
"For these analyses, we classified women by the joint distribution of pre-pregnancy lean or overweight status (<25 vs. â‰¥ 25 kg/m2) and snoring during early pregnancy (no vs. yes) thus resulting in the following categories: lean and non-snorer (the reference group); lean and snorer; overweight and non-snorer; and overweight and snorer.",1

Methods\nDietary intake was estimated using a food frequency questionnaire among 33 623 women aged 30-49 years at enrolment (1991/92).,1
Information on psychotic-like symptoms was derived from a follow-up questionnaire in the years 2002/03.,1
"Participants were classified into three predefined levels: low, middle and high frequency of symptoms.",1
The association between diet and psychotic-like symptoms was summarized in terms of relative risks (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals and was evaluated by energy-adjusted multinomial logistic regression.,1
"Results\n18 411 women were classified as having a low level of psychotic-like symptoms, 14 395 as middle and 817 as having a high level.",1
"The risk of high level symptoms was 53% (95% CI, 30-69%) lower among women who ate fish 3-4 times per week compared to women who never ate fish.",1
The risk was also lower for women with a high intake of omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA compared to women with a lower intake of these fatty acids.,1
"The RR comparing the highest to the lowest quartile of omega-6 PUFAs intake was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.64-0.97).",1
"Women in the highest compared with the lowest quartile of vitamin D consumption experienced a 37% (95% CI, 22-50%) lower risk of psychotic-like symptoms.",1
The typical age of onset for schizophrenia is early adulthood (20-25 years of age).,1
Expression of psychotic symptoms in populations is continuous and characterized by differing levels of severity and persistence [7].,1
"Neuronal membranes are largely made up of phospholipids, and the brain phospholipids are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).",1
"The main groups of PUFA are omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, of which some need to be supplied through the diet.",1
"Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) belong to the omega-3 family, and are mainly found in fatty fish.",1
"Methods\n\nStudy population\nWomen aged 30-49 years, residing in the Uppsala Health Care Region in Sweden during 1991 and 1992, form the source population for this study.",1
"[""Of this source population, 96 000 women were randomly selected from four age strata (30-34, 35-39, 40-44 and 45-49 years) and were invited to participate in the Swedish component of the Scandinavian Women's Lifestyle and Health Cohort [19,20].""]",1
"The women were asked to fill in a paper questionnaire, including a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and levels of fish, PUFAs and vitamin D intake were evaluated.",1
"Of those invited, over half decided to participate.",1
"Thus, 49 261 returned the questionnaires and were enrolled in the study.",1
"In 2002/2003 a follow-up study was initiated, and women who had responded to the 1991/1992 questionnaire and who were alive and living in Sweden in October 2002 were contacted.",1
"Since 1991/1992, 688 women were deceased, and 491 women had emigrated.",1
"47 859 women were invited to complete a web-based questionnaire, and non-responders received a paper questionnaire.",1
"The overall response rate was 72%, and 34 415 answered the follow-up questionnaire and levels of psychotic-like symptoms was measured (outcome under study).",1
A detailed description of the follow-up study and exposure assessment has been described elsewhere [21].,1
The Swedish Data Inspection Board and the regional Ethical Committee approved the study.,1
"Ratings of positive psychotic-like symptoms\nThe follow-up questionnaire contained 20 questions on psychotic-like symptoms, (Additional file1), constituting the positive symptoms of the CAPE (Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences) questionnaire, a modified version of the Peters et al.",1
"Delusions Inventory, [PDI; [22]]; which is based on the 9thedition of the Present State Examination [23].",1
"[""The questions are styled in a 'Do you ever feel/think' fashion in order to study continuous experiences during life-time.""]",1
The questions were translated from English into Swedish and back-translated to increase fidelity to the original scale.,1
"Two independent professional translators did the back-translation, and the consensus version was tested in a pilot study with 50 subjects.",1
"From the responses to the questions on positive psychotic-like symptoms, a variable was created by categorizing women into three groups (Additional file1).",1
"The ""low level symptoms group"" included women with no or few experiences of psychotic-like symptoms (â‰¤3 ""sometimes"" and no ""almost always"" and ""often"" answers to any of the questions).",1
"The ""high level symptoms group"" included women with frequent experiences of psychotic-like symptoms (â‰¥3 ""almost always"" or ""often"" answers).",1
"The ""middle level symptoms group"" was defined as participants not included in the low level or high level groups.",1
"Diet and lifestyle exposure assessment\nThe self-administered questionnaire in the parent study assessed lifestyle variables (smoking history, alcoholic drinking), anthropometry (height, weight, body mass index, BMI), medical history (previous diagnosis of major diseases) and average intake of foods and beverages [19].",1
"[""Dietary habits during the 6 months preceding the woman's enrolment in the study were ascertained through a validated FFQ that covered the frequency of consumption and quantity of about eighty food items and beverages [26].""]",1
The validity of the fat estimates from the FFQ assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients between FFQ data and estimates derived from weighed food records varied between r = 0.4 and r = 0.5.,1
The validity of PUFA estimated by means of the FFQ was r = 0.5 in comparison to adipose tissue composition [26].,1
"As part of the FFQ, the participants reported how often, on average, they ate salmon-type fish (Baltic herring, herring, or mackerel), white fish (cod, saithe, or pike), caviar, or shellfish (e.g., shrimp): never-seldom, 1-3 times/month, 1 time/week, 2 times/week, 3-4 times/week, 5-6 times/week, 1 time/day, 2 times/day or 3 times/day.",1
The average intake of food items from the FFQ were converted into average intake of energy and nutrients by linkage to the database of nutrients created by the Swedish National Food Administration [27].,1
"To estimate the total intake of omega-3 fatty acids, we summarized the intake of Î±-linolenic, EPA, DHA and docosapentaenoic acids (DPA).",1
"We combined EPA, DHA and DPA to estimate the total intake of marine fatty acids.",1
"To estimate the total intake of omega-6 fatty acids, we combined the intake of arachidonic and linoleic acids.",1
"AA exists in limited levels in liver, meat and eggs, but can be metabolized in humans from other fatty acids in the omega-6 fatty acid family.",1
"Linoleic acid is the parent fatty acid of the omega-6 family, and the main source in a typical Swedish diet is vegetable oil (such as corn oil, sunflower oil, soy oil, rapeseed oil and margarine).",1
"Î±-linolenic acid, the parent fatty acid of the omega-3 family can, to a limited extent, be converted into EPA, DPA and DHA.",1
"Conventional dietary sources of Î±-linolenic acid are rapeseed oil, soy oil, dark green leafy vegetables, flax seed, walnuts and soy beans.",1
"EPA and DHA are mainly found in fatty fish, with levels that vary by the species of the fish, environmental factors and geographic area [27].",1
"Statistical methods\nAmong the 34 415 women included in the study, we had information on dietary intake (parent study) and psychotic-like symptoms for 34 310 women (follow-up study).",1
Participants with an energy intake outside the first (2261 kJ/d) and 99th (12 335 kJ/d) percentiles were excluded from the analysis (n = 687).,1
"Thus, a total of 33 623 women were included in the analysis.",1
"Baseline characteristics between the low and the high level group of psychotic-like symptoms were compared using a two-sided t-test for equal means for continuous, normally distributed variables and and Ï‡2-test for categorical variables.",1
Non-normally distributed variables were log-transformed to normalize the distribution.,1
"The association between fish, fatty acids or vitamin D and psychotic-like symptoms was summarized in terms of relative risk ratios (RRRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals, and it was evaluated by energy-adjusted multinomial logistic regression (polytomous logistic regression), for example: RRR = P(y = high level group; fish intake >2/week)/P(y = low level group; fish intake >2/week)/P(y = high level group; no fish intake)/P(y = low level group; no fish intake).",1
The estimated associations given by a multinomial logistic regression are relative risk ratios (RRR).,1
"[""For simplicity of language we abbreviated 'relative risk ratio' to 'relative risk' (RR).""]",1
"Nutrient density was calculated by dividing the estimated intake of fatty acids, vitamin D and other nutrients by the total energy intake (i.e., the multivariate nutrient density model) [28].",1
"The intake of fatty acids and vitamin D was categorized into quartiles, with the lowest quartile as the reference category for comparison.",1
"The intake of individual seafood items was grouped into four categories (none, 1-3 times per month, 1 time per week and 2 times per week or more).",1
"The total intake of all fish and seafood was grouped into six categories (none, 1-3 times per month, once per week, twice per week, 3-4 times per week and 5 times per week or more).",1
"Age- and energy-adjusted models (with age in 5-year intervals and total energy intake as a continuous variable) were fitted, as well as models adjusted for additional potential confounders, including categories of BMI (< 25, 25-29.9, 30 or more), level of education (0 to 10 years, 10-13 years, 13+ years), country of birth (Nordic countries or other countries), smoking (yes, no), and intake of selected food groups and nutrient densities (fish other than the main exposure of interest, meat, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, cereals, refined sugar, alcohol, fatty acids other than the main exposure of interest, retinol, and vitamins A, B6, and B12), categorized into quartiles, as well as rheumatoid arthritis (yes, no), gluten intolerance (yes, no), diabetes (yes, no), intake of multivitamin supplements (never, occasional, regular).",1
"In an additional analysis of the association between alcohol intake and psychotic-like symptoms, we categorized women into never drinkers or drinkers, and used drinkers as the reference category.",1
They are listed in the table footnotes.,1
Statistical analyses were performed using the STATA version 10.0\n\nResults\n\nCharacteristics of study participants\nBaseline characteristics of the study participants are presented in Table1.,1
"The women in the high level group of psychotic-like symptoms were significantly younger, had a higher prevalence of overweight and obesity and were less educated than women with less or no experience of psychotic-like symptoms.",1
"Furthermore, a higher proportion of the women in the middle and high level symptoms groups had grown up outside of the Nordic countries than women in the low level symptoms group of psychotic-like symptoms.",1
"The RR comparing growing up outside of the Nordic countries for the middle group and the high level group compared with the low level group was 1.7 (95% CI, 1.5-2.0) and 5.6 (95% CI, 4.0-6.8), respectively.",1
Women with no or few psychotic-like symptoms smoked less than women in the middle group and the high level group.,1
"The RR comparing ever smokers to never smokers, for the middle group and the high level group compared with the low level group was 1.2 (95% CI, 1.1-1.3) and 1.5 (95% CI, 1.3-1.7), respectively.",1
There was no association between alcohol intake and psychotic symptoms among women in the middle and low psychotic-like symptoms groups (data not shown).,1

"Vitamin D is to a large extent metabolized in the body through sun exposure, and people with dark skin need more sun exposure to maintain adequate blood levels.",1
[43].,1
A high intake ratio of omega-3:omega-6 fatty acids favor omega-3 fatty acid metabolism.,1
"For example, high intake of omega-3 fatty acids partly replaces omega-6 fatty acids incorporation into membrane phospholipids and omega-3 fatty acids have a higher affinity than omega-6 fatty acids for several enzymes [44].",1
"Among women in the group with the highest level of psychotic-like symptoms, overweight, obesity and smoking were more common, and this group also contained more women who had migrated to Sweden.",1

Introduction\nGliomas are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms in terms of cellular origin and location.,1
They represent the most common malignant brain tumors [1].,1
"Except for a small percentage of cases, the tumors continue to show high morbidity and mortality.",1
Established risk factors include ionizing radiation and a few genetic syndromes [2].,1
"The period between an environmental exposure and the appearance of cancer may be lengthy, as illustrated by the development of vaginal cancer in daughters years after their mothers used diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy [3].",1
Methods\n\nSearch Strategy\nArticles were identified by systematically searching the Medline/PubMed database from inception to January 2010 using the key words: brain tumors and season of birth.,1
"Furthermore, we manually examined the bibliography of the papers that were identified electronically.",1
"We also searched for unpublished studies, PhD dissertations, internal reports, and conference proceedings/abstracts.",1
"Finally, to make our search inclusive of those studies in which season of birth was a secondary factor we checked the tables of every article known to us that examined risk factors for brain tumors.",1
A similar process was used to identify papers on risk factors related to season of birth.,1
"Inclusion Criteria\nStudies were included only if the target population, outcome and exposures of interest were clearly defined and results were based on valid statistical methodology with evaluation of errors and discussion of study bias.",1
Studies in which participants were chosen at convenience were not considered in this review.,1
In the case of a cohort appearing in the literature multiple times only the most recent version was included since it provided the largest number of cases and the longest follow-up.,1
Priority was given to papers that presented original data rather than reviews or meta-analyses.,1
"Farming\nFarming, by virtue of its seasonal nature, conveys increased risk at certain times of the year of exposure to pesticides and other agricultural chemicals.",1
"Insecticides and herbicides constitute the bulk of farm chemical exposures: two key routes of exposure are dermal and respiratory [27], bypassing detoxification in the liver.",1
"Indoor exposures to these agents frequently occur [29,30].",1
"Parents and other individuals track dust and dirt into the home, on shoes and clothes, after working on the farm.",1
"Similarly, indoor-outdoor pets are efficient carriers of agents into the home, and also pose an exposure source for pesticides from anti flea/tick collars, sprays, and shampoos.",1
"Airborne farm pollutants also may enter the home environment by way of the wind, after spraying, gassing, or open-air application.",1
"Newborn and infant children have greater contact with these contaminants since they lie, crawl and play near the ground and frequently place their hands, objects or food in their mouths [29,33,34].",1
"For example, their skin surface area is comparatively larger and more permeable to lipophilic compounds, which serves to maximize the absorption of compounds such as pesticides into the bloodstream [35â€“37].",1
"Once in the circulatory system, compounds enter the brain of the infant relatively quickly as the blood-brain barrier is not fully operational until at least 6 months of age [10].",1
"At birth, children are less able to detoxify chemicals and other inorganic substances commonly used on farms [33,34], and they tend to have higher concentrations in their blood due to a decreased capacity to bind plasma protein [35].",1
"They drink more water and eat more foods per unit of body weight than adults and will therefore ingest more toxins from well water and agriculturally treated foods [33,34].",1
"Furthermore, they are more sensitive to airborne chemicals since their resting air intake is about twice that of an adult [34].",1
"The commonly used organophospate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) is known to specifically target the immature brain, from the early embryonic stage to the postweaning period, and it causes a host of irreversible changes to developing brain cells [39].",1
"Allergies and Immunity\nThe perinatal period represents a time of heightened sensitivity to environmental allergens [51,52].",1
"In the case of cockroach sensitivity, over 60% of inner-city residents with asthma test positive for cockroach allergen [79], with black children and those receiving public assistance most likely to be sensitized [70].",1
"The rate of cockroach sensitization at the age of 5 years was higher for winter births (72%), than for spring (48%), summer (42%) and fall (43%) births [70].",1
"A significant percent of infants with a history of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis infection, which peaks during the winter season, develop asthma [64].",1
"In animal studies, therapeutic immunity to intracranial tumors has been induced by peripheral immunization with interleukin-4 (IL-4) transduced glioma cells [100,101].",1
"The latter tend to live and work in a more closed indoor environment and thus suffer greater exposure to indoor pollutants (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls, phthalates, phenols, flame retardants) [29].",1
"In particular, a 7.5-fold OR (95% CI = 1.3â€“44.9) for low grade astrocytoma has been observed for neonatal urinary tract infections [141].",1
"Other factors include poor nutrition, crowding, seasonal travel, hygiene practices, cultural practices in food consumption/preparation, changes in herd immunity, or evolution of the infectious agent over time.",1
Vitamin D\nVitamin D is a fat-soluble prohormone which operates via a nuclear receptor [145].,1
"Certain foods and the chemicals contained in these foods may be more or less available at particular times of the year due to crop cycles, storage capability, transportation access, and cost; and the use of preservatives in foods also may vary accordingly.",1
"N-nitroso compounds are a potent inducer of cancer and brain tumors in various animal species [159,160], and fetal exposure produces more tumors than postnatal exposure [161].",1
"Vitamin C, which is mostly found in seasonal fruits and vegetables, can react with and then inhibit nitrite formation of nitrosamines [163].",1
Birth Weight\nBirth weight has been reported to vary by season of birth [168â€“170].,1
"For example, birth weights in agricultural societies are highest at the peak of the dry season, corresponding to the time of harvesting and greatest food availability [174].",1
"Women exposed in utero to the estrogen-like compound DES show a higher prevalence for left handedness [195,196].",1
"Handedness has been shown to follow a gender-invariant seasonal pattern, with more left-handers than right-handers born between March and July [177,178].",1
"However, little seasonal variation exists in the light/dark cycle in the area where the majority of study participants were born [208].",1
Risk for glioma also is nearly equal for left-handed and ambidextrous individuals but higher for right-handers.,1

"Allergy is a hypersensitivity reaction initiated by specific immunologic responses [1,2] against foreign, usually harmless, substances.",1
"The most common allergens worldwide include pollen, dust mites, molds, animal dander, cockroach, insect venom, and certain foods.",1
Classification and Mechanism\nHypersensitivity against allergens can be mediated by either antibodies or T lymphocytes.,1
"The sensitization process involves the production of allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, which are fixed to mast cells via their high-affinity receptor, Fc epsilon receptor I (Fc Îµ RI).",1
"On a subsequent encounter with the allergen, bridging of 2 or more IgE antibodies leads to degranulation of the mast cell with release of preformed mediators such as histamine, serotonin, tryptase, chymase, kininogenase, and heparin.",1
"The mediator release results in the well-recognized acute allergic inflammation characterized by itching, redness, and tissue edema involving the skin, respiratory tract, circulation, and gastrointestinal tract.",1
"After degranulation, mast cells lose membrane area, become activated, and start a de novo synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes from membrane arachidonic acid [4,5].",1
Late-phase reactions are observed several hours to days after allergen contact.,1
"In the United States, about 18% to 30% of women in the childbearing age have allergic diseases, especially rhinitis [8] and asthma [9].",1
These disorders represent the most common group of medical conditions that complicate pregnancy.,1
Asthma\nCertain physiological changes occur normally during pregnancy (Table2) [17].,1
The physiologically elevated position of the diaphragm and hyperventilation in pregnancy further increase the risk of hypoxia.,1

Education about asthma and its interaction with pregnancy reduces anxiety and improves compliance.,1
Rhinitis\nSignificant nasal symptoms occur in approximately 30% of pregnant women [23].,1
"The most common causes of nasal symptoms necessitating treatment during pregnancy are AR, rhinitis medicamentosa, sinusitis, and (non-AR) vasomotor [24].",1
Vasomotor rhinitis of pregnancy is a syndrome of nasal congestion and vasomotor instability limited to the gestational period.,1
"Allergic rhinitis commonly coexists with asthma; 80% of asthmatic adults also have AR, and 20% to 50% of patients with AR also have asthma [25].",1
"In a group of 1245 adult patients with documented asthma, 24% had seasonal AR only, 6% had perennial AR only, and 22% were considered to have both [26].",1
"Adjunctive treatment of rhinitis, which is permitted in pregnancy, includes oxymetazoline drops or spray for nasal congestion, pseudoephedrine (after the first trimester) for persistent nasal congestion, and buffered saline sprays for nasal dryness, nasal bleeding, and vascular congestion associated with pregnancy.",1
The reactions occurred within 1 to 3 days postpartum and resolved within 1 to 2 days.,1
The management of anaphylaxis during pregnancy is the same as for nonpregnant patients.,1
The results of this observational study were based on questionnaires filled out by the mothers after childbirth.,1
"Atopic Eczema (Dermatitis)\nGestational itchy dermatoses are relatively common, with eczema being diagnosed in 30% to 50% of all cases [41].",1
Most women with atopic dermatitis have lived with their condition long before becoming pregnant.,1
The first step in treatment of urticaria and angioedema in pregnancy is identification and avoidance of causative factors.,1
The diagnosis and treatment of drug allergy are the same in pregnant as in nonpregnant patients.,1
The same applies to in vivo tests such as food challenge tests and patch tests.,1
"Examples include the occurrence of generalized eczema requiring identification of the cause before treatment or a suspected allergy to a drug needed for therapy of the mother (eg, penicillin for treating syphilis) [50].",1
Summary\nMany women experience type I allergies during pregnancy.,1
"In general, treatment of asthma and allergic diseases does not differ from that in nonpregnant women.",1
"If neither parent is allergic, the chance for allergies in the child is about 15%.",1
"If 1 parent is allergic, the risk increases to 30%, and if both are allergic, the risk is greater than 60%, especially for developing the same organ-specific symptoms [54].",1
"For instance, interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were detected in the colostrums of healthy women [64].",1
"In addition to the previously mentioned soluble factors, also cells are transferred in utero, for instance, leukocytes pass from mother to fetus.",1
"In addition, total and specific IgE levels,[72,73] total eosinophil counts,[74] incidence of airway disease,[74] and positive results on skin prick tests [75] were also increased in children who were exposed to smoke either during pregnancy or in early childhood.",1
"Alcohol consumption in adults is also a risk factor for elevated specific IgE levels against food antigens [77,78].",1
"Use of Antiacid Medications\nThe changing hormone levels during pregnancy lead to a lower esophageal sphincter pressure in the mother, and concomitantly with growing volume of the fetus, these factors often result in heartburn, reflux, and abdominal pain.",1
"Prematurity and Low Birth Weight\nAs shown within the Manitoba birth cohort study, prematurity and low birth weight are not associated with an increased risk for development of food allergy in childhood [90].",1
"Primary prevention addresses symptom-free children at risk (ie, without the established disease).",1
Secondary prevention addresses individuals with early indicators of atopic disease.,1
Tertiary prevention is directed at patients with a chronic disease to prevent additional problems related to the disease.,1
"In addition, a significant percentage of infants from families with an atopic background do not develop atopy during childhood.",1
This review will deal only with dietary and environmental control measures (see later) for the prevention (primary and secondary) of atopic diseases.,1
"This process is active and specific, much like the process of sensitization [119].",1
"For more information on primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of allergy, readers are referred to the document, ""Prevention of Allergy and Allergic Asthma,"" an article based on findings presented at the World Health Organization/World Allergy Organization meeting in January 2002 [120].",1
This document also includes a summary of evidence-based guidelines and strength of recommendations.,1

"In overweight/obese (OW/OB; n = 132) mothers, greater % kcal from sweets early in pregnancy was the strongest, independent predictor of higher weight for age (WFA) (beta = 0.19; P = 0.004), higher odds of macrosomia (OR = 1.1 (1.0â€“1.2); P = 0.004) andWFA > 90th percentile at birth (OR = 1.2 (1.1â€“1.3); P = 0.002) and higher WFA at 6 months (beta = 0.30; P = 0.002).",1
"In normal weight ( n = 153) mothers, higher intake of soft drinks was the strongest predictor of higher offspring WFA at birth (beta = 0.16; P = 0.04) but not at 6 months.",1
"Prenatal physical activity, depressive symptoms, and sleep-related variables did not significantly predict offspring weight outcomes.",1
1,1
One powerful early life exposure is maternal obesity during pregnancy.,1
Another independent determinant of offspring weight status is gestational weight gain (GWG).,1
"Also, approximately 40% of normal weight women gain more than recommended [6], increasing the risk of obesity in their offspring.",1
2,1
Materials and Methods\n\n2.1.,1
"Participants and Procedures\nParticipants were offspring of women recruited into the Fit for Delivery study, a clinical trial that examined the effects of a lifestyle intervention to reduce excessive GWG in normal weight and overweight/obese women (Clinical Trials no.",1
01117961) [16].,1
"As reported previously [16], the intervention reduced excessive GWG in normal weight but not overweight/obese women.",1
Normal weight and overweight/obese categories were based on the 1990 IOM cut points [17]: normal weight BMI = 19.8 to 26.0 or overweight/obese BMI 26.1â€“40.0 [17].,1
"Women were recruited at the time of their first prenatal visit from one of six obstetric offices serving a socioeconomic and ethnically diverse population in Providence, RI from 2006 to 2008.",1
"Eligibility criteria included nonsmoking, adults (age >18 years), fluency in English, access to telephone, gestational age between 10 and 16 weeks, singleton pregnancy, no current or history of eating disorders, and without major psychiatric illness (i.e., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and panic/anxiety disorder) or major medical problems, including diabetes, stroke, and cancer.",1
"All mothers provided written informed consent, and all procedures were conducted in accordance with ethical standards for human experimentation.",1
Mothers were paid $25 for attending the 30-week gestation and 6-month postpartum assessments.,1
"The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the Miriam Hospital, in Providence, RI., Women and Infants Hospital of Rhode Island Providence, RI and California Polytechnic State University, in San Luis Obispo, Calif.\n\n2.2.",1
Measures\n\n2.2.1.,1
"Background Information\nAt study entry, participants reported via questionnaire information on maternal race/ethnicity, age, education, parity, employment, marital status, and household income.",1
"For descriptive purposes, the race variable was defined as non-Hispanic Caucasian, Latina/Hispanic, African-American, and â€œother.â€ In other analyses, race was categorized as non-Hispanic Caucasian versus all other groups combined.",1
"Income was categorized as >$25,000 per year versus â‰¤$25,000.",1
Mothers also reported duration of breastfeeding on postpartum questionnaires.,1
2.2.2.,1
Maternal Anthropometrics\nMaternal pregravid weight was based on self-report at time of study enrollment and was shown to be valid compared with physician documented prepregnancy weight [16].,1
Height was measured by trained research staff using a stadiometer at study entry and was used with pregravid weight to calculate BMI.,1
Total GWG was computed based on pregravid weight and weight at the last clinic visit prior to delivery.,1
Weight at the last clinic visit was objectively measured using a calibrated digital or balance beam scale by research assistant or clinic staff.,1
Data were collected before the 2009 IOM guidelines were released.,1
"Based on the 1990 IOM guidelines [17], we classified GWG as â€œexcessiveâ€ in normal weight women whose gains were more than 35 pounds (15.9\u2009kg) and overweight (BMI >26 to 29) women whose gains were above 25 pounds (11.4\u2009kg).",1
"Similar to other studies, we combined overweight and obese (BMI 29â€“40) women in our analysis and, thus, also set an upper weight gain goal of 25 pounds (11.4\u2009kg) for these heaviest women [19].",1
2.2.3.,1
Infant Anthropometrics\nTrained research staff abstracted infant and child weight and length from obstetric and pediatric records.,1
We computed birth weight for gestational age z -scores using US Natality reference data from Oken et al.,1
[20] and defined small for gestational age (SGA) at birth as WFA z -scores <10th percentile and large for gestational age as WFA z -scores >90th percentile.,1
Macrosomia was defined as weight >4000 grams [21].,1
We computed 6-month WFA and sex-specific z scores with 2000 CDC reference data [22] and defined risk of obesity as WFA z -scores >90th percentile.,1
Other variables abstracted from infant medical records included infant sex and gestational age at birth (calculated from last menstrual period or from second trimester ultrasound if the two estimated differed by >10 days).,1
2.2.4.,1
Behavioral and Psychosocial Factors during Pregnancy\nSelf-reported measures of dietary intake and exercise expenditure were obtained by trained assessors at study entry and 30-weeks gestation.,1
"The Block Food Frequency questionnaire was used to assess daily caloric intake, calories from sugar-sweetened beverages, and percent intake from fat, protein, carbohydrates, and sweets.",1
This questionnaire has been well validated [23] and validated in pregnancy [24].,1
Participants completed the questionnaire in reference to intake over the past month.,1
Fast food consumption was assessed based on self-report questions used in our previous research [25].,1
"Energy expenditure was measured using the Paffenbarger Physical Activity Questionnaire [26], a measure which estimates weekly energy expenditure from self-reports of stairs climbed, blocks walked, and other recreational activities performed in the past week.",1
The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to examine levels of depressive symptoms [27].,1
The Eating Inventory (EI) [28] was used to assess cognitive restraint and disinhibition.,1
Stress was assessed using the short form of the Perceived Stress Scale [29].,1
Sleep was assessed using the General Sleep Disturbance questionnaire [30].,1
2.3.,1
Statistics\nBoth R (version 2.11.1) and SPSS (PASW version 18.0.1) statistical packages were used.,1
"Analyses were conducted separately for normal weight and overweight/obese women, given the observed difference in impact of the lifestyle treatment on GWG [16] and effects of maternal prepregnancy weight on offspring weight outcomes [31].",1
"[""Pearson's product moment correlations were conducted to examine unadjusted associations between WFA z -scores and maternal variables.""]",1
"Multiple regression (for continuous outcomes) and logistic regression (for categorical outcomes) were used to examine predictors of infant macrosomia, and WFA z -scores at birth and 6 months, and changes in WFA z -scores, adjusting for treatment group, infant sex, recruitment clinic, weeks of gestation at delivery, and breastfeeding (in 6-month analyses).",1
Predictors included both baseline and pregnancy changes over time (between entry and 30-weeks gestation).,1
"To determine the most robust set of predictors and correlates of infant outcomes, multiple regression analyses were used.",1
"To arrive at a final regression model, stepwise analyses were first conducted within predefined categories (i.e., demographic (age, parity, race, marital status, education, prepregnancy BMI), physical activity (calories expended per week in moderate physical activity TV hours per day), macronutrient (% of calories from fat, carbohydrates, protein, sweets, and total calories), dietary components (fast food and sugar-sweetened soft drinks) psychosocial variables (mood, restraint, disinhibition, and stress), and sleep.",1
Variables that were significant or approached significance ( P< 0.10) within each category in the stepwise analyses were included together in a comprehensive model.,1
"Macronutrient (i.e., % kcal from sweets, fat, and protein) and specific dietary components (i.e., fast food or soft drinks) were analyzed in separate models due to their high collinearity.",1
"Similarly, as the percentage of calories from fat and carbohydrates was highly correlated ( r = âˆ’.90; P = .0001), only the percentage of calories from fat was used in initial modeling.",1
Similar analyses were conducted using logistic regression to examine impact on odds of macrosomia.,1
"Prepregnancy BMI was also examined as a categorical predictor (median split within weight groups), but the same results were observed.",1
Exploratory analyses examined whether treatment condition (intervention versus standard care) interacted with dietary variables and physical activity in predicting offspring weight status.,1
"After adjustments (infant sex, recruitment clinic, weeks of gestation at delivery, and breastfeeding), no significant interactions were observed in normal weight or overweight/obese mothers (data not shown).",1
3,1
Results\n\n3.1.,1
"Participant Characteristics\nExcluding participants with miscarriages ( n = 6) and GDM ( n = 32), 363 mothers (177 overweight/obese and 186 normal weight) completed the baseline assessment, which occurred between 10 and 16 weeks of pregnancy (13 weeks on average).",1
"At 30 weeks, 341 (94%; 160 overweight/obese and 181 normal weight) attended the assessment visit.",1
"Of these, 78.5% ( n = 285/363; 132 overweight/obese and 153 normal weight) had pediatrician records at birth and 68.6% ( n = 249/363; 121 overweight/obese and 128 normal weight) had pediatrician information at 6 months.",1
There were no significant differences in retention or availability of pediatrician records in normal weight versus overweight/obese mothers at all time points.,1
"Comparing mothers of children with versus without pediatrician records at 6 months, those with pediatrician records were older (29.0 Â± 5.1 versus 27.4 Â± 5.5 years; P = .008), more likely to be non-Hispanic White (73.8% versus 53.0% P =\u2009\u2009.0001), and more likely to be married (74.6 versus 55.7%; P =\u2009\u2009.001); no significant differences were observed in prepregnancy BMI, education, income, weeks of gestation at delivery, or maternal GWG.",1
3.2.,1
"Maternal BMI and Offspring Weight Parameters\nAt birth, WFA z -scores were significantly higher for offspring of overweight/obese compared with normal weight mothers (0.42 Â± 0.92 versus 0.21 Â± 0.76, resp.",1
; P =\u2009\u2009.002).,1
"Similarly, a greater proportion of offspring from overweight/obese mothers were classified as macrosomic (>4000 grams; 17.2% versus 4.8%, resp.",1
; P =\u2009\u20090.0001) and at >90th percentile at birth (19.6% versus 7.1%; P =\u2009\u2009.001;Table 1).,1
"At 6 months, no significant differences in WFA z -scores were observed between offspring of normal weight and overweight/obese mothers.",1
"Between birth and 6 months, the percentage of children with WFA >90th percentile declined slightly in overweight/obese mothers (from 19.6% to 17.6%) but increased from 7% to 15% in the offspring of normal weight mothers (Table 1).",1
Subsequent analyses separately examined predictors of offspring weight in normal weight versus overweight/obese mothers.,1
3.3.,1
Prenatal Predictors of Offspring Weight\n\n3.3.1.,1
"Multiple regression analyses were then conducted to determine the most robust set of predictors of offspring weight parameters after adjustment for treatment group, infant sex, recruitment clinic, weeks of gestation at delivery, and breastfeeding (in 6-month analyses).",1
"Examining predictors of birth weight, the strongest predictor of higher WFA z score was consumption of a greater percentage of calories from sweets early in pregnancy (beta = 0.19; P =\u2009\u20090.004;Table 3).",1
Each 1% increase in percentage of calories consumed from sweets early in pregnancy increased the odds of macrosomia by 10% and WFA >90th percentile by 20%.,1
"At 6 months, the strongest predictors of higher WFA z -scores were greater percentage of calories from sweets early in pregnancy (beta = 0.30; t = 3.2; P =\u2009\u20090.002) and also greater increases in percentage of calories from protein during pregnancy beta = 0.20;Table 3).",1
"Higher percentage of calories from protein early in pregnancy (OR = 0.38 (0.19, 0.78); P =\u2009\u20090.04) was also a significant predictor of reduced odds of WFA >90th percentile at 6 months.",1
"Children of overweight/obese mothers who were exposed to excessive GWG ( n = 84) had an approximate 4.0-fold increase in odds (CI (1.0, 15.1); P =\u2009\u20090.04) of being macrosomic and had higher WFA z -scores at birth (0.62 Â± 0.84 versus 0.05 Â± 0.95; P =\u2009\u20090.002) compared with children exposed to adequate GWG.",1
"Also, at 6 months, children exposed to excessive GWG had near significant ( P =\u2009\u2009.06) higher odds of WFA z score >90th percentile compared with children exposed to adequate weight gain (OR = 6.2 (0.94, 41.1), but no significant association was seen on WFA z -scores (0.45 Â± 0.14 versus 0.08 Â± 0.18; P =\u2009\u2009.11).",1
"When analyzing maternal GWG as a continuous measure, similar results were observed.",1
"Total GWG was positively predictive of higher child WFA z score at birth (beta =.41; t = 4.9; P =\u2009\u2009.0001) and macrosomia at birth (OR = 1.2 (1.1, 1.3); P =\u2009\u20090.001).",1
"At 6 months, no significant effects were seen for GWG on odds of WFA >90th percentile ( P =\u2009\u2009.11) or average z -scores ( P =\u2009\u2009.16) at 6 months.",1
3.4.,1
"In final, multiple regression analyses that included adjustments for confounding variables, the strongest predictor of higher WFA z score at birth was greater consumption of soft drinks early in pregnancy (beta = 0.16; P = 0.04;Table 4).",1
The omnibus tests of model coefficients predicting macrosomia and WFA >90th percentile at birth were insignificant and few cases of each were observed.,1
"At 6 months, higher percentage of calories from fat early in pregnancy was a significant predictor of lower WFA z -scores (Table 4; beta = âˆ’0.35; P = 0.001) and reduced odds of WFA >90th percentile (OR = 0.81 (0.70, 0.94); P =\u2009\u2009.007).",1
"Similar, but in the inverse direction, results were observed in models where percentage of calories from carbohydrates (instead of fat) was included (B = 0.04 (0.01, 0.06); beta = 0.27; P =.006 for WFA z and OR = 1.1 (1.1, 1.3); P = 0.005 for WFA >90th percentile).",1
"Children of normal weight mothers who were exposed to excessive GWG ( n = 71) had higher WFA z -scores at birth (0.42 Â± 0.75 versus 0.03 Â± 0.73; P = 0.002) compared with children exposed to adequate GWG, but no significant effects were seen on odds of macrosomia or WFA z score >90th percentile.",1
"At 6 months, children of normal weight mothers exposed to excessive GWG had significantly ( P = 0.03) higher odds of WFA z score >90th percentile compared with children exposed to adequate weight gain (OR = 4.0 (1.2, 13.6)), but no significant association was seen on WFA z -scores at 6 months (0.27 Â± 0.83 versus 0.39 Â± 1.1; P =\u2009\u2009.28).",1
"When analyzing maternal GWG as a continuous measure, no significant effects were observed.",1
4,1
"In normal weight mothers, higher intake of soft drinks was the strongest predictor of higher offspring weight status at birth but was not a significant predictor of weight at 6 months.",1
"By contrast, in normal weight mothers, lower fat intake (and higher carbohydrate intake) early in pregnancy was a significant predictor of higher offspring weight at 6 months.",1
Low levels of physical activity and sedentary lifestyle are known contributing factors to obesity and weight gain in the general population [40].,1
"Also, few maternal psychosocial predictors of offspring weight status were observed within both overweight/obese and normal weight mothers.",1
"Infants of overweight/obese mothers had higher WFA z -scores at birth than nonexposed counterparts, but the postnatal weight trajectories were different.",1
"The offspring of overweight mothers were larger at birth but, by 6-months, did not significantly differ from those of normal weight mothers.",1
In fact the percentage of infants of normal weight mothers with WFA z -scores >90th percentile doubled between birth and 6-months.,1
We found no significant prenatal predictors of change in WFA z -scores between birth and 6 months.,1
"The study was able to adjust for several important confounds, including length of gestation and infant sex; however, the sample size was moderate, and only 69% of the offspring (mostly non-Hispanic White) had data available at 6 months.",1
The study lacked a valid measurement of infant height.,1
"Although prepregnancy weight was self-reported, our research has found that women in this study were quite accurate in recalling prepregnancy weight [16].",1
"Also, excessive GWG was classified based on the 1990 IOM GWG guidelines; our data were collected before the newly revised 2009 IOM GWG guidelines were released.",1

The aim of the primary treatment is an adequate excision of the primary tumour and any loco-regional extension.,1
"According to the extent of the disease, hemithyroidectomy or radical thyroidectomy is performed.",1
"When radical thyroidectomy is performed, the second most frequently used post-operative adjuvant therapy for non-pregnant patients with DTC is radioactive iodine (RAI, I-131) administered to eradicate persistent neck disease or distant metastatic lesions.",1
Follow-up\nFollow-up is planned according to the stage of the disease and to the extent of the surgery performed.,1

"MTCs, like other neuroendocrine tumours, can express somatostatin receptors.",1
Follow-up of MTC patients suspected for recurrence can therefore be performed by using the somatostatin analogue octreotide (octreoscan).,1
The presence of somatostatin receptors provides the basis for treatment with longacting analogues of somatostatin or with Y-octreotide (DOTATOC) in some patients.,1

All covariate data were collected from a structured inpatient medical record review.,1
"Birth weight percentile was calculated using the Fenton growth chart from gestational age and birth weight in grams (Fenton 2003), allowing us to account for gestational age in our birth weight metric and to create a normalized distribution for birth weight through birth weight percentile.",1
"Birth weight percentile was stratified into three clinically meaningful categories to create birth weight status: SGA babies, defined as babies whose birth weight lies below the 10th percentile for that gestational age; appropriate for gestational age (AGA) babies, defined as babies whose birth weight lies above the 10th percentile for that gestational age and below the 90th percentile for that gestational age; and large for gestational age (LGA) babies, defined as babies whose birth weight lies above the 90th percentile for that gestational age.",1
DNA methylation analysis.,1
Repetitive element DNA methylation was determined by bisulfite pyrosequencing of the LINE-1 and the AluYb8 repetitive elements as previously described (Bollati et al.,1
2007;Choi et al.,1
2009).,1
Methylation extent was calculated as the mean LINE-1 methylation of four positions in the element and mean AluYb8 methylation of five positions in the element.,1
Pyrosequencing of these repeat elements was successful in 380 samples; we noted no significant differences in the demographics or clinical characteristics of these samples compared with the larger population.,1
"To examine gene-related CpG methylation on a subset of the samples ( n = 184), methylation was measured at 27,578 CpG loci using the Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadArray (Illumina, San Diego, CA).",1
"The microarrays were processed at the University of Californiaâ€“San Francisco Institute for Human Genetics and Genomics Core Facility, following standard protocols.",1
"The methylation status for each individual CpG locus was calculated as the ratio of fluorescent signals:\nÎ² = max( M ,0)/[max( M ,0) + max( U ,0) + 100],\nusing the average probe intensity for the methylated ( M ) and unmethylated ( U ) alleles.",1
Ratios range from 0 to 1: Î² = 1 indicates complete methylation and Î² = 0 represents no methylation.,1
"The data were then assembled using BeadStudio methylation software (version 1.9.0; Illumina), without normalization, per the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.",1
We used array control probes to assess the quality of our samples and evaluate potential problems such as poor bisulfite conversion or color-specific issues for each array.,1
"Mahalanobis distance was used to screen outliers, and all CpG loci on X and Y chromosomes were excluded from the analysis, to avoid sex-specific methylation bias, leaving a final 26,486 autosomal CpG loci representing 13,890 unique genes (Poage et al.",1
2011).,1
"We and others have previously demonstrated that methylation of CpG loci detected through BeadArray platforms can be reliably replicated using alternative detection techniques including pyrosequencing, MassARRAY analysis, and quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (Ang et al.",1
2010;Christensen et al.,1

"2010,2011;Wolff et al.",1
2010).,1
Statistical methods.,1
Univariate associations of exposures and demographics with birth weight percentile status or with LINE-1 and AluYb8 extent were examined using Kruskalâ€“Wallis tests for continuous covariates and chi-square tests for categorical covariates.,1
A Pearson correlation was used to examine the correlation between LINE-1 and AluYb8 extents.,1
Multiple linear regression was then used to evaluate the association between LINE-1 or AluYb8 methylation levels and continuous birth weight percentile.,1
"All models were adjusted for infant sex and maternal age, body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy, ethnicity (non-Caucasian/Caucasian), and alcohol, tobacco, and prenatal vitamin use during pregnancy (all yes/no).",1
"To check the linearity assumption for the regression models, we plotted residuals by birth weight percentile for all models and found no evidence for systematic nonlinearity.",1
"To examine how repetitive element methylation was related to gene-associated methylation, we restricted our analysis to placentas for which we had both repetitive element and gene-associated (array) methylation data for the 26,486 CpG autosomal loci ( n = 184).",1
"Using a data-driven recursively partitioned mixture model (RPMM), these CpG loci were clustered into 16 methylation classes based on like methylation pattern obtained from the array results, pruning the model after four splits to maintain power (Houseman et al.",1
2008).,1
"For each subject, 16 corresponding aggregate methylation values were obtained by averaging together average methylation Î²-values from all CpGs within each class.",1
"RPMM classes were labeled using a series of numbers, ranging from 1 to 16 (with class 1 having the lowest methylation level and class 16 having the highest methylation level).",1
"RPMM was selected for this analysis because we have demonstrated that RPMM provides more consistent clustering and more robustness in the selection of the number of classes because of its hierarchical presentation of classes, compared with metric hierarchical clustering, for this data set [see Supplemental Material, Supplementary Text 2 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1103927)].",1
"An alternative, attribute-driven clustering scheme for the 26,486 autosomal CpG loci was employed by grouping CpGs by epigenetically relevant bioinformatic attributes: CpG island (CGI) status (Takai and Jones 2002), polycomb group (PcG) target status of the associated gene [i.e., gene was described as a PcG target in at least one ofBracken et al.",1

"The characteristics of subjects used in these analyses ( n = 380) are shown in Supplemental Material,Table 1(http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1103927).",1
"Because subjects were selected based on SGA status and matched to non-SGA infants on sex, gestational age, and maternal age, we observed no significant differences in those characteristics among birth weight groups (SGA, AGA, LGA).",1
"Significant differences were noted between groups for maternal ethnicity and maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy, with a greater proportion of non-Caucasian infants ( p = 0.01) and infants with exposure to tobacco smoke in the SGA category ( p = 0.03).",1
The vast majority of mothers reported prenatal vitamin use; only three subjects reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy.,1
DNA methylation and infant growth.,1
"Mean LINE-1 and AluYb8 methylation levels differed significantly by birth weight status [see Supplemental Material,Table 1(http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1103927); p< 0.0001].",1
"Mean methylation across the 26,486 autosomal CpG loci was not significantly associated with the birth weight groups (see Supplemental Material,Table 1).",1
There were no significant differences in the distributions of the demographic characteristics of this subsample and the larger population examined for LINE-1 and AluYb8 methylation extent (data not shown).,1
"These models demonstrate that with a 10% increase in LINE-1 mean methylation levels, birth weight percentile significantly increased by 9.7 (95% CI: 2.9, 16.6), and with a 10% increase in AluYb8 mean methylation levels, birth weight percentile significantly increased by 14.5 (95% CI: 4.9, 24.0) (Table 1).",1
"Both models were adjusted for infant sex and maternal age, BMI, ethnicity, and tobacco, alcohol and prenatal vitamin use during pregnancy.",1
Infant sex and maternal ethnicity were also significant predictors of birth weight percentile (Table 1); all other covariates were not significant.,1
DNA methylation and in utero exposures.,1
Table 2presents the results of our exploration of the differences in the measures of DNA methylation by various in utero exposures.,1
"Only AluYb8 methylation levels differed by infant sex ( p = 0.04), with male infants having slightly higher mean AluYb8 methylation (mean Â± SD = 65.3 Â± 3.3) than did female infants (64.6 Â± 3.3).",1
"Furthermore, we found that mean AluYb8 levels differed significantly by maternal tobacco use during pregnancy ( p< 0.01), whereas mean LINE-1 levels significantly differed only by maternal alcohol use during pregnancy ( p = 0.02;Table 2).",1
"Array-based mean methylation across the 26,486 CpG loci did not differ by any of the in utero exposures explored.",1
Relationships between repetitive element and gene associated methylation.,1
"To investigate the relationship between repeat element methylation and gene-associated methylation, we clustered the 26,486 autosomal CpG loci interrogated on the Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadArray into 16 methylation classes based on their methylation pattern using an RPMM [for the heat map of the 16 classes, see Supplemental Material,Figure 1(http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1103927)].",1

The association between LINE-1 or AluYb8 methylation and average methylation within the RPMM-derived classes for each of the 184 individuals in the study is presented inFigure 1.,1
"To examine similarities in the genomic context of the CpGs making up these data-driven RPMM classes, we examined the proportion of CpG loci associated with specific DNA sequence features within each class, including location within a repetitive element (LINE-1, LINE-2, Alu, or MIR), within a CGI, or having the associated gene considered a PcG protein target gene (Figure 2).",1
"As expected, a greater proportion of CpGs in the relatively methylated (rightmost) classes 9â€“12 are localized in repetitive elements (Figure 2Aâ€“D).",1
"Conversely, a high proportion of CpGs in the relatively unmethylated classes 1â€“6 and 8 are in CGIs (Figure 2E).",1

At the prenatal stage mRNA expression profiles were extensively altered between the dietary groups.,1
At this time point the fetuses were subjected to a serious nutritional deficiency that requires an acute transcriptomic response.,1
Following in utero exposure to a gestational low protein diet at 1 dpn we could not find significant regulatory changes of genes of any molecular route in porcine perinatal liver.,1
At this stage the animals experienced a kind of release from metabolic burden after cross-fostering and suckling.,1
"[""Obviously, this initiates an immediate recovery of the activity of genes to 'normal level' reflected by similar expression pattern in LP and AP piglets.""]",1
"However, at the whole-body level adverse consequences of restricted intrauterine supply were observed [15].",1
"In juvenile LP offspring, mRNA expression profiles were moderately altered compared to AP offspring.",1
"However, the number of differentially expressed probe-sets increased extensively at adult stage.",1
The observed transcriptional postnatal regulations were delayed long-term effects of the prenatal nutritional supply.,1
"Due to the LP diet a number of molecular routes related to cell cycle and cellular turnover, response to stimuli, as well as energy-, lipid- and amino acid metabolic pathways are shifted on the transcriptional level in the liver at prenatal stages under the direct influence of limited protein and/or amino acid supply, but also postnatal.",1
"The effect is characterised by a programming of the genome that leads to different responsiveness and adaptability of the gene expression machinery to chronic and acute environmental stimuli, i.e.",1
nutritional supply.,1
Transcriptional excursions regarding cell maintenance and proliferation\nMammalian cell division is precisely regulated by variate factors and functional networks.,1
"Therefore, cell division is synchronous with cell growth [19,20].",1
Eukaryotic cells evolved elaborate mechanisms to verify the fidelity of cell division.,1
"Therefore, a cell cycle control system can arrest the cycle at certain checkpoints.",1
Key components in terms of cell cycle regulation are cyclins.,1
"Cyclin levels undergo an oscillation of synthesis and degradation in each cell cycle and fall at a proper developmental time point to exit the cell cycle [21,22].",1
"Therefore, the transcriptional control of cyclins provides an additional level of growth regulation.",1
"Mitotic cyclins interact with Polo-like kinases (PLK), an evolutionary conserved family of essential cell cycle regulators, which are required at several key points within mitosis, including entry into and exit from mitosis [23,24].",1
The porcine expression patterns in this study showed a decreased mRNA expression of genes associated with the control of mitosis and cell cycle checkpoint regulation at stage 94 dpc in LP fetuses.,1
"In AP fetuses, cell cycle parameters were found to be decreased in expression within developmental period I, which indicates a terminated fetal growth.",1
"In contrast, LP fetuses showed an increased expression of transcripts associated with cell division within the corresponding developmental period.",1

Samples were GC-RMA normalised (Log2).,1
The MAS5 algorithm was used to skip those transcripts which were expressed in less than 50% of the animals within one dietary group per stage.,1
For a second filtering step standard deviations were calculated for each probe-set over all subsets of arrays of the particular comparisons.,1

"Methods\nWe did a randomised placebo-controlled trial to compare oral 100\u2008000 IU (2Â·5 mg) vitamin D3with placebo given to children aged 1â€“11 months in Kabul, Afghanistan.",1
Randomisation was by use of a computer-generated list.,1
Vitamin D or placebo was given by fieldworkers once every 3 months for 18 months.,1
Children presenting at the study hospital with signs of pneumonia had their diagnosis confirmed radiographically.,1
Our primary outcome was the first or only episode of radiologically confirmed pneumonia.,1
Our analysis was by intention to treat.,1
"This study is registered withClinicalTrials.gov, numberNCT00548379.",1
Findings\n1524 children were assigned to receive vitamin D3and 1522 placebo.,1
"There was no significant difference between the incidence of first or only pneumonia between the vitamin D (0Â·145 per child per year, 95% CI 0Â·129â€“0Â·164) and the placebo group (0.137, 0Â·121â€“0Â·155); the incidence rate ratio was 1Â·06 (95% CI 0Â·89â€“1Â·27).",1
Interpretations\nQuarterly bolus doses of oral vitamin D3supplementation to infants are not an effective intervention to reduce the incidence of pneumonia in infants in this setting.,1
Funding\nWellcome Trust and British Council.,1
This trial of 100\u2008000 IU (2Â·5 mg) vitamin D3(cholecalciferol) supplementation along with antibiotic treatment of children younger than 3 years with clinically diagnosed pneumonia in Kabul showed no difference in the time to recovery between the groups.,1
"In the presence of adequate concentrations of calcifediol (25-hydroxyvitamin D), CYP27B1 leads to an increase synthesis of intracellular calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D).",1
"The binding of this to vitamin D receptors in turn results in increased intracellular formation of antimicrobial compounds, such as cathelicidins.5The generation of intracellular antimicrobial compounds is impaired in patients who are vitamin D deficient (ie, low serum concentrations of calcifediol).",1
"In Afghanistan, dietary intake of vitamin D is low10and exposure of women to sunlight is limited by the widespread use of the burqa.",1
"We selected infants from inner-city Kabul because we knew the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency12and incidence of pneumonia3,15were high.",1
"Methods\n\nParticipants\nBetween Nov 4 and Dec 4, 2008, we did a community based randomised placebo-controlled superiority trial in Kabul, Afghanistan, within the catchment area of the Maiwand Teaching Hospital, which serves an inner-city population.",1
"Follow up ended in May, 2009.",1
The children we enrolled into our study largely came from five of the 18 socioeconomically deprived inner-city districts.,1
"We identified households with young children with detailed maps and advice from staff of the Agha Khan Trust for Culture, a non-governmental organisation working in the region.",1
"Furthermore, the study field-supervisors mapped the region independently to verify the accuracy of the maps of the Agha Khan Trust for Culture, and during recruitment they visited every house in the mapped region to identify families with young children.",1
20 pairs of female fieldworkers visited every home starting from streets closest to the hospital and radiating out until we reached our required sample size.,1
Those homes where the carer or infant was absent were revisited again within 4 weeks of the recruitment period.,1
Our inclusion criteria were infants aged 1â€“11 months and living in our study region.,1
"Our exclusion criteria were families expecting to move to another town within 18 months, diagnosis of rickets or treatment with vitamin D in the previous 3 months, and clinical diagnosis of Kwashiorkor or Marasmus.",1
"The fieldworkers obtained written informed consent from the mother, father, or another senior family member before recruitment; allocated the unique identification number (sequentially); and gave the first dose of vitamin D3or placebo.",1
Children with vomiting were excluded temporarily and enrolled 2 weeks later after recovery.,1
"[""Thumbprint or signature consent was obtained from the child's parents (mother and father if in Kabul or another family member responsible for the child) at home if the child met our study criteria and after either the parent read the Dari consent form or it was explained to him or her by the fieldworker.""]",1
"Our study was approved by the ethics and review board of the Ministry of Public Health of Afghanistan (reference 422328; issued May 12, 2007) and the ethics committee of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (application number 5117; issued May 29, 2008).",1
"Randomisation and masking\nAn independent statistician (Shabbar Jaffar, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK) randomised unique identification numbers individually in fixed blocks of 20 to the vitamin D3or placebo group by use of a random number generator with the SAS routine.",1
"By use of the randomisation list, a pharmacist in the Department of Pharmacy, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi prepared 100\u2008000 IU (2Â·5 mg) of vitamin D3(cholecalciferol) in olive oil (Sinochem Ningbo Laboratory, China) or placebo (olive oil) in sealed 2 mL plastic syringes labelled with the unique identification numbers.",1
"The vitamin D3and the placebo were the same colour (pale yellow), taste, and quantity (0Â·5 mL) and therefore the study staff and the families did not know to which group the children were assigned.",1
Fieldworkers allocated children to randomisation groups during recruitment and gave vitamin D or placebo.,1
"We provided each child with an identification card, which included a photograph of the child, to enable easy access to outpatient and out-of-hours paediatric services at the study hospital.",1
We encouraged families to bring their children to the study hospital for any illness for which quality treatment was offered free of charge.,1
"Four experienced paediatricians and 30 female fieldworkers (medical students, nurses, midwives, or community health workers) were rigorously trained in our study protocols, the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses strategy, and the assessment of signs and symptoms required by our study.",1
The quality of clinical assessment in the clinics and during home visits was monitored weekly by study supervisors.,1
"The fieldworkers followed up the children every 2 weeks until June, 2009, to obtain background information, assess illness (symptom history and examination of chest in-drawing, body temperature [Thermoval Classic Hartmann digital thermometer], signs of dehydration by skin pinching, respiratory rate count over 1 min with a stopwatch), and to refer to the study hospital if needed.",1
Respiratory rate and anthropomorphic data were collected twice and we used the mean values in our analysis.,1
All children clinically diagnosed with pneumonia were offered free chest radiographs taken by radiographers trained by a WHO trainer.,1
"The masked radiographs were read by two independent paediatric radiologists (based at the Acute Respiratory Infections Unit of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences), experienced in reading paediatric chest radiographs from WHO vaccine trials, with WHO proformas for standardised interpretation of paediatric chest radiographs for the diagnosis of pneumonia.17In case of disagreement, radiographs were read by a third independent radiologist and most decisions were accepted.",1
"We ascertained causes of death through scrutiny of hospital notes, and verbal autopsy interviews with the WHO standard questionnaire and review of the interview data by two physicians independently.",1
"We defined clinical pneumonia as a history of cough plus increased respiratory rate for age, chest in-drawing, or any danger sign (ie, not drinking or breastfeeding, convulsion, vomiting, lethargic or unconscious, stridor in a calm child).",1
We defined severe pneumonia as cough plus chest in-drawing and very severe diseases as cough plus any danger signs.,1
Our primary endpoint was the first episode of pneumonia from the time of enrolment confirmed by chest radiograph (consolidation or infiltrates).,1
We defined as a new episode of pneumonia an episode happening 15 days or longer after the first.,1
We judged an episode happening within 14 days to be continuation of the previous episode.,1
We collected venous blood samples from randomly selected blocks of children on the basis of the assumption that each block had an equal number of children from the vitamin D3and placebo groups.,1
This was to ascertain calcifediol serum concentrations 1 week after giving the first dose in the placebo group (a baseline value for the whole population) as well as early concentrations after the first vitamin D supplementation in the intervention group (70 in placebo and 69 in intervention groups).,1
We also collected samples at other times (appendix) from a different set of randomly selected children to check fluctuations in serum concentrations.,1
"We stored the serum samples at âˆ’20Â°C and analysed them at the end of our study with IDS-iSYS Multi-Discipline Automated Chemiluminescent assay (Immunodiagnostic Systems Ltd, Tyne and Wear, UK) at the Manchester Royal Infirmary, Manchester, UK (Supra-Regional Vitamin D Reference Laboratories accredited to ISO9001:2000 and ISO13485:2003 and participating in the Vitamin D Quality Assurance Scheme).",1
Thus a study with 80% power and 95% significance needed 22\u2008079 child-months per group (total of 2454 children for 18 months follow-up).,1
Assuming a 20% loss to follow-up and allowing for protocol violations we intended to recruit 3050 children for 18 months follow-up.,1
Data were entered into a Microsoft Access database (version 2007) and data processing and analysis was done in STATA (version 11.0).,1
We compared baseline characteristics and the distribution of our prestated confounders for intervention and placebo groups.,1
"If a child was not seen for more than 45 days, at the two weekly visits, or at the hospital, they were censored for that period of our study.",1
These children could re-enter the study when next seen.,1
"We calculated person-time at risk for each child up to the date a child reached our primary endpoint, was last seen at the end of our study, or when censored because they were lost to follow-up.",1
For our intention-to-treat analysis we included all children randomly assigned to our study groups.,1
For our per-protocol analysis we included children who in both groups received all doses with an interval between the doses of 60 and 120 days and had not violated the randomisation codes.,1
We analysed the repeat episodes accounting for clustering within individuals.,1
We made initial comparisons of time-to-an-episode between the two groups with log-rank tests and Kaplanâ€“Meier plots.,1
We estimated the incidence rate ratio (RR) for the episodes of pneumonia with Cox proportional hazard models.,1
"This study is registered withClinicalTrials.gov, numberNCT00548379.",1

Results\nFigure 1shows the trial profile.,1
By the end of our trial 2616 of the 3046 recruited children were present in our study and 17 had died.,1
The mortality rate in our study cohort was 4Â·2 per 1000 child years (95% CI 2Â·4â€“6Â·7): 4Â·2 per 1000 child years (2Â·4â€“6Â·7; ten cases) in our vitamin D group and 3Â·4 per 1000 child years (1Â·3â€“7Â·1; seven cases) in our placebo group.,1
Six children in the vitamin D and four in the placebo group died of septicaemia or pneumonia.,1
The remaining seven deaths were due to accidental or congenital causes.,1
We did not record any immediate or other adverse events associated with vitamin D3supplementation.,1
The number of children lost to follow-up was low and many children lost at one time because of travel rejoined the study later with rates being similar between the two groups (figure 1).,1
"There was no statistically significant difference in any of the baseline characteristics between the groups (table 1), including reported sun exposure.",1
Children that remained in our study had equally balanced characteristics.,1
We did not identify any correlations between baseline variables.,1
The incidence rate of repeat episodes of all type pneumonia was significantly higher in the vitamin D group (table 3).,1
"Restricting the definition of pneumonia confirmed with chest radiography to consolidation only, gave a rate of 0Â·011 per child per year (95% CI 0Â·008â€“0Â·017) in the vitamin D group and 0Â·008 (0Â·005â€“0Â·013) in the placebo group; this difference was not significant RR 1Â·44 (0Â·76â€“2Â·72).",1
"Extending the time between two consecutive episodes of pneumonia to 30 days to define a new repeat episode of pneumonia (used by the WHO Vaccine Trials group),19gave similar results (data not shown).",1
The proportion of children without an episode of pneumonia during our 18 month study did not differ between the groups (figure 2).,1
"The incidence of first episodes of simple, severe or very severe pneumonias confirmed with chest radiography also did not differ (table 1,appendix).",1
"There were very few protocol violations and the results of our per-protocol and post-hoc analyses for children getting four and five consecutive doses were not different from that of our intention-to-treat analysis (table 2, 3;appendix) A further post-hoc analysis of the pneumonia rates by season also did not reveal any difference between the groups in our intention-to-treat or per-protocol analyses (data not shown).",1
"One child in the first sample (1 week after the first dose in November, 2008) and one in the spring sample (a month after the second dose) of the intervention group had results greater than 375 nmol/Lâ€”a toxic level.6\n\nDiscussion\nOur trial in a population known to be vitamin D deficient shows that 100\u2008000 IU (2Â·5 mg) of vitamin D3supplementation once every 3 months did not affect the incidence or severity of childhood pneumonia, in this population.",1
"Similarly, vitamin D3supplementation did not affect hospital admissions and all-cause mortality.",1
Our trial had a large sample size with a low loss to follow-up that remained within our sample size estimates.,1
Frequent home visits confirmed outcomes of interest.,1
Supplementation raised the serum concentration of calcifediol in the intervention group at several points in our study.,1

Introduction\nIron deficiency anaemia is defined as anaemia accompanied by depleted iron stores and signs of a compromised supply of iron to the tissues [1].,1
"There is variation in haemoglobin levels during pregnancy; at the beginning of a pregnancy, there is a normal reduction in haemoglobin level followed by a slight rise towards the end of pregnancy [2].",1
2,1
"The following search terms were used: prevalence, burden, iron deficiency, anaemia in pregnancy, preventive treatments, and developing countries.",1
"[""Cross-sectional, observational, and randomized control trials' literature on the subject published between 2000 and 2011 served as the main sources of information.""]",1
"These works of literature were obtained from the commonly used medical databases such as PubMed (Medline), AJOL, and Google Scholar; in addition, Cochrane Library was used as source for systematic reviews on the subject matter.",1
"The search generated 27 related articles in the following categories: prevalenceâ€”2, treatmentsâ€”8, reviewsâ€”6, interventions/trialsâ€”6, dosageâ€”1, and technical reportsâ€”4.",1

Results\n\n3.1.,1
Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemia in pregnancy [2].,1
3.2.,1
Evidence-Based Preventive Treatment Options\n\n3.2.1.,1
"In the first trimester, daily needs decrease due to the absence of menstruation; thereby saving about 0.56\u2009mg of iron per day, or 160\u2009mg for the pregnancy [15].",1
"In the second trimester, blood volume increases by 45% with an increase in plasma volume of 50%; red cell mass is raised by 35% which amounts to about 450\u2009mg of iron in a 55\u2009kg woman [4].",1
"Iron deficiency in nonpregnant populations can be measured quite precisely using laboratory tests such as serum ferritin, serum iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation, and transferrin receptors [7].",1
"Iron supplements can be given by mouth and parenteral route as intramuscular and intravenous injections; in addition, it can be administered as blood transfusion and recombinant erythropoietin with iron.",1
3.2.2.,1
"Food Fortification with Iron\nIron fortification involves the addition of iron, usually with folic acid, to an appropriate food vehicle that is made available to the population at large.",1
Elemental iron powders are the most widely used iron compound in fortification programmes since about 50 years [32].,1

PubMed Central:,1
The women were selected via a multi-stage proportionate-to-size sampling design.,1
Blood samples were collected and a questionnaire was completed face-to-face.,1
55 obstetric clinics were randomly selected and 1311 pregnant women participated in the study.,1
The median serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25-(OH)D] concentration was significantly lower in the first trimester (20.4 ng/ml) than in third trimester (22.7 ng/ml).,1
The risk of vitamin D deficiency (25-(OH)D <20 ng/ml) was significantly higher for less educated women and women who reported not going on holidays to sunny climates.,1
"The risk of severe vitamin D deficiency (25-(OH)D <10 ng/ml) decreased for women who reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy, decreased with more frequent use of sunscreen lotion and increased for smokers and women who reported preference for shadow.",1
"Vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of osteoporosis[3]and fractures[4], while in its most severe form it causes rickets in children[5]and osteomalacia in adults[6].",1
"Humans get vitamin D (cholecalciferol) from exposure to sunlight, diet and dietary supplements.",1
"As few food items contain or are fortified with vitamin D (such as liver, fatty fish, eggs, milk and dairy products, soy milk, butter, margarines), the skin synthesis of vitamin D induced by ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) is the main determinant of vitamin D status in the population[23].",1
Vitamin D once synthesized in the skin is metabolized into 25-dihydroxyvitamin D [25-(OH)D] in the liver.,1
"25-(OH)D is then metabolized in the kidney by the 1-Î± hydroxylase to the active steroid hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D].",1
Several modifications of vitamin D metabolism occur during pregnancy.,1
"The expression of 1-Î± hydroxylase is increased in the kidney and placenta and the concentration of serum 1,25-(OH)2D increases in normal pregnancy from the first to the third trimester.",1
Methods\n\nEthics Statement\nThis study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and all procedures involving human subjects were approved by the medical ethical committee of the Erasme hospital in Brussels.,1
The subjects provided written consent for participation in the study.,1
Sampling\nThe target population of the survey comprised all pregnant women in Belgium during the first and the third trimester of pregnancy in the period from September 2010 to June 2011.,1
The women were selected according to a multi-stage proportionate-to-size stratified sampling design as recommended for studies assessing iodine deficiency[31].,1
The country was divided into two regions.,1
In each region the obstetric clinics were ordered by province and size based on the number of deliveries during the past year and 60 clusters of 4 clinics were selected per region using systematic sampling in order to have enough replacement clinics in case some refused to participate.,1
"Out of these 60 clusters, 30 clusters were randomly selected and within each cluster the first clinic was invited to participate.",1
The aim was to include 22 women in each cluster of which 11 in the first trimester and 11 in the third trimester of pregnancy.,1
"Data Collection\nBlood samples were collected from the antecubital vein and a general questionnaire about socio-demographic and socio-economic characteristics, smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy and during the 4 weeks prior to the interview, diseases and medication and use of food supplements was completed in a face-to-face interview conducted by the study nurse.",1
"Women from Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and Western Sahara were considered of North African descent.",1
"For all women included in the study, body mass index (BMI) was obtained from weight and height recorded by the gynaecologist during the first prenatal consultation in the beginning of the first trimester of pregnancy.",1
Analysis of Samples\nApproximately 5 ml whole blood was collected by venipuncture in a non-heparinized tube.,1
Serum aliquots were then stored at â€“80C for further analysis.,1
"Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-(OH)D) concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay (Diasorin, Stillwater, MN, USA).",1
"Statistical Analyses\nThe statistical analyses were carried out using STATA 10.1 (StataCorp, Texas, USA).",1
"As serum 25-(OH)D is not normally distributed, non-parametric methods were used.",1
The median was used as the measure of central tendency.,1
"Differences between regions, trimesters and age groups were explored using two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Kruskal-Wallis equality-of-populations rank test.",1
"The odds of having a serum 25-(OH)D concentration lower than 20 ng/ml (vitamin D deficiency) versus a non deficient vitamin D status were estimated through multiple logistic regressions while entering the following variables as predictors in the model: season, age, trimester of pregnancy, region, BMI, smoking behaviour, alcohol consumption, use of vitamin D-containing food supplements, fish consumption, milk and dairy product consumption, education level, ethnicity, parity, exposure to sunlight during weekdays, exposure to sunlight during weekend days, use of sunscreen lotion, use of solarium, shadow or sun preference and sometimes going on holidays to sunny climates (yes/no question).",1
In addition the odds of having a serum 25-(OH)D concentration lower than 10 ng/ml (severe vitamin D deficiency) versus a non severe deficient vitamin D status were estimated through multiple logistic regressions while entering the same predictors in the model.,1

"In pregnancy, acute type A aortic dissection has an overall incidence of 0.4 cases per 100,000 person years [2].",1
"Common risk factors for developing aortic dissection include hypertension, collagen disorders including Marfan/Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, bicuspid aortic valve, positive family history, trauma, and cocaine use [3â€“7].",1
Mechanisms leading to aortic dissection involve a weakening of the layers of the aorta allowing blood to enter the media and separate the intimal and adventitial layers creating a false lumen.,1
"These changes include increased total circulatory volume, increased systemic blood pressure, and structural changes in the aortic wall secondary to the hormonal effects of estrogen and progesterone [4].",1

A draft list of 40 questions was revised by a group of experts.,1
"These were divided into four categories and concerned knowledge of general dietary recommendations during pregnancy, the sources of nutrients, the roles of nutrients during pregnancy, and the importance of breastfeeding.",1
Participants could respond â€œyesâ€/â€œnoâ€/â€œdonâ€™t knowâ€ to each question.,1

"To validate the nutritional knowledge questionnaire, item analysis was performed to determine item difficulty and item discrimination indices to increase reliability.",1
"The items that were too difficult, too easy, or that were found to have near-zero or negative discrimination were eliminated.",1
"As a result, 26 items were included in the final analysis.",1
"The Cronbachâ€™s Î± coefficient was acceptable for all sections (general recommendations, 0.66; sources of nutrients, 0.77; the role of nutrients, 0.77), except for breastfeeding (0.60), which was therefore eliminated.",1

Ethical considerations\nThe study was approved by the ethics committee of the â€œGrigore T. Popaâ€ University of Medicine and Pharmacy in IaÅŸi and permission to administer the questionnaires was received from the Cuza-VodÄƒ Obstetrics and Gynaecology Clinical Hospital.,1
Those who participated gave written informed consent.,1
Those younger than 18\xa0years gave their consent in the presence of and with the approval of one of their parents or legal guardians.,1
All data were anonymised to maintain participant confidentiality.,1
"Socio-demographic characteristics of the study group and description of prenatal care\nThe mean age of participants was 27.5\xa0years: 63.8% were aged between 19 and 30\xa0years, 5.3% were â‰¤18 years and 8.8% were aged over 35\xa0years.",1
The majority lived in an urban area (54.3%).,1
"Regarding formal education, 25.5% had completed less than 8\xa0years of school, whereas 34.0% had a university degree.",1
The majority of women (80.8%) were married.,1
"Primiparous and secundiparous women were predominant (49.5% and 32.3%, respectively); 10.0% of women declared that the pregnancy was unwanted (Table\xa01).",1
Most women (96.0%) registered their pregnancy with their general practitioner and had the first prenatal visit in the second (61.0%) or the third (19.0%) month; only 9.0% of women had the first visit in the fifth month.,1
The average number of visits to the general practitioner was 4.8\u2009Â±\u20092.54.,1
The mean number of check-ups with the obstetrician was 4.7\u2009Â±\u20093.07; but 16.5% of women did not see an obstetrician during their pregnancy.,1
"The mean total number of combined visits was 9.58 Â±4.88: 18% of participants made â‰¤4 visits, 28.5% made between 5â€“9 visits and 53.3% had â‰¥10 visits.",1
Less than half the participants (42.0%) declared they received advice on diet during pregnancy and 83.5% stated they were advised to breastfeed (Table\xa01).,1
The intake of vitamin and mineral supplements was significantly less common in women who declared the pregnancy was unwanted.,1
"Women with a higher level of nutritional knowledge used folic acid, iron and multivitamin supplements more frequently (Table\xa02).",1

Materials and methods\nThe planned implementation consisted of a 9-month pre (usual care)/post (new model of care) design with a month for â€˜integrationâ€™ across 2012-2013.,1
Primary outcomes were uptake of the new dietetic schedule (process) and requirement for pharmacotherapy (clinical).,1
"Secondary outcomes were change in: staffâ€™s awareness, knowledge, and acceptance of the model, and change in client satisfaction (process), and in dietary indices, physical activity levels, and key maternal and infant outcomes (clinical).",1
"Post-intervention, significantly more women (50.6%) received best-practice care (2+reviews) (p = 0.02).",1
This was more pronounced in women who received best-practice care (25.0% (yes) vs. 27.2% (no)).,1
"However, this was significant between women who received best practice care (-7.9 Â± 6.1) and not best practice care (-2.1 Â± 4.4, p = 0.014), and also pre-intervention women (p=0.01).",1
"Differences in physical activity levels were clinically, but not significantly different (15.5 mins vs 9l.8mins/week).",1
"Client satisfaction remained high over the project, between 4.3-4.7/5.",1
Staff are currently being surveyed regarding their guideline knowledge and acceptance.,1
Clinical outcomes are currently being examined.,1
Conclusions\nThis implementation project was successful in increasing the proportion of women seen according to best practice.,1

"UCP1 is expressed in classical brown adipocytes, as well as in â€œbeige cellsâ€ in white adipose tissue (WAT).",1
The thermogenic activity of BAT is mainly controlled by the sympathetic nervous system.,1
"Endocrine factors, such as fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and bone morphogenic protein factor-9 (BMP-9), predominantly produced in the liver, were shown to lead to activation of BAT thermogenesis, as well as to â€œbrowningâ€ of WAT.",1
"This was also observed in response to irisin, a hormone secreted by skeletal muscles.",1
"When studied under thermoneutral conditions, UCP1 knockout mice exhibited markedly increased metabolic efficiency due to impaired thermogenesis.",1
"It is defined as an accumulation of adipose tissue that is of sufficient magnitude to impair health (WHO,2014).",1
"The normal BMI range is 18.5â€“25 kg/m2, although the range may vary for different countries.",1
Individuals with a BMI above 30 kg/m2are classified as obese; those with a BMI between 25 and 30 kg/m2are considered to be overweight.,1
"In general, the term obesity applies to both the obese and the overweight subjects.",1
"Two different types of adipose tissue have been described: brown adipose tissue (BAT), composed mainly of brown adipocytes, and white adipose tissue (WAT), defined by a majority of white adipocytes, both tissues being able to accumulate lipids in intracellular droplets.",1
"WAT is an energy-storing tissue that has evolutionary enabled humans to survive for longer periods between meals, storing energy mainly as triglycerides and releasing fatty acids during fasting periods.",1
"In recent times, when food has become cheaper and more widely available, excessive WAT storage contributed to the worldwide alarming development of obesity mentioned above (World Health Organization,2009).",1
"White adipocytes are composed of a large single, spherical lipid vacuole and a peripherally located nucleus, together with few mitochondria.",1
"WAT has endocrine activity, secreting several factors and hormones, such as leptin and adiponectin.",1
"Under certain conditions, another type of adipocytes, named brite or beige cells, can be found dispersed within some of the WAT depots.",1
"These cells, which will be discussed below, present a phenotype with metabolic properties that are closest to brown than to white adipocytes.",1
"BAT consists in brown adipocytes, characterized by multiple, small, multilocular lipid droplets with a central nucleus and a high number of mitochondria.",1
BAT is a highly vascularized tissue innervated by the sympathetic nervous system.,1
The mitochondria of BAT are characterized by the presence of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) in the inner mitochondrial membrane.,1
"When activated, this protein uncouples mitochondrial respiration from ATP synthesis, resulting in heat production, a process that consumes substantial amounts of fuels.",1
"BAT, the principal effector organ of non-shivering thermogenesis (i.e., heat production that does not involve skeletal muscle contraction), is present in most mammals and its maturation in the perinatal period varies between species, according to their developmental status at birth (Tews and Wabitsch,2011).",1
"In humans, BAT develops in the fetus during gestation.",1
"Thus, the amount of UCP1 increases during fetal development, peaks at birth, before declining over the first 9 months (Lean et al.,1986; Tews and Wabitsch,2011).",1
"In 2009, functional human BAT was identified in adults by a combination of CT scans and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) (Cypess et al.,2009; van Marken Lichtenbelt et al.,2009; Virtanen et al.,2009).",1
"The areas in which BAT is observed in adult humans include supraclavicular, neck, paravertebral, and suprarenal sites (Nedergaard et al.,2007).",1
"BAT activity is well known to mostly rely on lipid metabolism, UCP1 being directly activated by fatty acids (Cannon and Nedergaard,2004).",1
"In addition to using lipids, BAT also displays a very high rate of glucose uptake, particularly under sympathetic activation (Cannon and Nedergaard,2004).",1
"This tissue also responds to insulin with a 5-fold increase in glucose uptake, without any change in blood flow (Orava et al.,2011), while under cold exposure, glucose uptake increases by 12-folds, dissipating energy as a function of increased blood flow (Orava et al.,2011).",1
"Regarding the fate of glucose in brown adipocytes under anabolic conditions characterized by high insulin levels, it is essentially metabolized to provide glycerol-3-phosphate for triglyceride synthesis or acetyl- CoA for de novo fatty acid synthesis (Cannon and Nedergaard,2004).",1
"In contrast, when bred under thermoneutral conditions (29Â°C), UCP1 knockout mice exhibited markedly enhanced metabolic efficiency due to impaired thermogenesis (Feldmann et al.,2009).",1
"In addition, brown adipocytes can be found scattered in WAT, especially upon cold exposure (Young et al.,1984; Guerra et al.,1998), treatment with Î²-adrenergic (Himms-Hagen et al.,2000), or with peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ (PPAR-Î³) agonists (Petrovic et al.,2010).",1
"These brown-like adipocytes have interchangeably been called â€œrecruitableâ€ (Tseng et al.,2008; Schulz et al.,2013), â€œbeigeâ€ (Ishibashi and Seale,2010; Auffret et al.,2012; Wu et al.,2012), or â€œbriteâ€ (for brown to white) (Petrovic et al.,2010; Gburcik et al.,2012) cells.",1
"Lineage-tracing studies showed that brown adipocytes in classic BAT areas derive from myogenic factor 5 ( Myf 5+)- positive progenitor cells, similarly to skeletal myocytes (Timmons et al.,2007).",1
"As mentioned above, BAT is the effector organ of non-shivering thermogenesis (both cold and diet-induced) that, by utilizing large quantities of glucose and lipids from the circulation, can promote negative energy balance.",1
"These effects are partly interrelated, but can also be dissociated and exerted by different UCP1-expressing types of adipocytes (i.e., brown and â€œbriteâ€ adipocytes).",1
"BAT activation by cold exposure, Î²3-agonist or thyroid hormone treatment was shown to improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (Cawthorne et al.,1984; Forest et al.,1987; Peirce and Vidal-Puig,2013).",1
Similar observations were obtained by adipose tissue-specific overexpression of PR-domain-containing 16 (PRDM16) in mice.,1
"This Zinc-finger transcription factor induces differentiation of brown adipocytes (Seale et al.,2011).",1
"Fibroblast growth factor 21 is a member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family that acts as a hormone and that, in contrast to other endocrine FGFs, is devoid of proliferative activity (Itoh,2014).",1
"It is expressed in BAT and WAT, although its main production site is the liver (Nishimura et al.,2000; Muise et al.,2008; Schulz et al.,2013; Zafrir,2013).",1
"Tissue-specific FGF21 regulation was shown to occur in response to chronic cold exposure in mice (Fisher et al.,2012).",1
"Under this condition, FGF21 expression was indeed decreased in the liver, but enhanced in BAT, as well as in WAT, where it acted to markedly increase UCP1 expression and the â€œbrowningâ€ of subcutaneous tissue (Fisher et al.,2012).",1
"FGF21 deficiency in mice was shown to result in impaired ability to adapt to long-term cold exposure with diminished â€œbrowningâ€ of WAT (Fisher et al.,2012).",1
"At the opposite, systemic administration of FGF21 in obese mice resulted in reduced adiposity, improved glycemic control, as well as increased energy expenditure, as mentioned by the authors (Coskun et al.,2008).",1

"Interleukin-6 (IL-6), predominantly known as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is secreted by skeletal muscle (Pal et al.,2014), helper T cells, as well as by WAT and BAT (Mohamed-Ali et al.,1997; Cannon et al.,1998).",1
"The treatment also enhanced UCP1 protein levels in BAT, via stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system (Li et al.,2002).",1
This was mediated by phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3).,1
"BAT transplantation also increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in BAT, WAT, and heart, but not in skeletal muscle (Stanford et al.,2013).",1
"Apart from IL-6, another circulating factor, named irisin, was shown to be produced by skeletal muscles during physical exercise in rodents (De Matteis et al.,2013).",1
"Irisin, obtained by cleavage from the precursor protein, fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (FNDC5), was described as promoting the appearance/recruitment of â€œbriteâ€ cells in white adipose depots (Bostrom et al.,2012; Lee et al.,2014a).",1
"Thyroid hormones (THs) are well known mediators of overall energy expenditure (Klieverik et al.,2009).",1
"Treatment with THs induces UCP1 expression in brown adipocytes in rats, following their binding to TH-responsive elements in the UCP1 promoter (Guerra et al.,1996).",1
"Type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2), responsible for the transformation of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3), is also inducing UCP1 expression locally, in BAT (de Jesus et al.,2001).",1
"Furthermore, treatment of brown adipocytes and human skeletal myocytes with bile acids (BA) were shown to increase D2 activity and oxygen consumption via the activation of UCP1 (Watanabe et al.,2006).",1
Thyroid receptors (TRs) are composed of several isoforms that specifically regulate UCP1 expression and thermogenesis.,1
"In humans, a unique patient suffering from extreme diabetes due to a mutation in the insulin receptor gene had to undergo total thyroidectomy because of the presence of a papillary carcinoma.",1
"A PET/CT study revealed the presence of BAT depots in the lower neck, suprascapular, mediastinal, and thoracic paravertebral regions.",1
Bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) are members of the transforming growth factor Î² superfamily (TGF-Î²).,1
"BMP8B, another member of the BMP family, was found to be expressed in BAT, as well as in the hypothalamus (Contreras et al.,2014).",1
"Central administration of BMP8B induced thermogenesis and increased core temperature, leading to weight loss (Contreras et al.,2014).",1
"This effect, exerted within the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), was described as being AMPK-dependent, resulting in the activation of the sympathetic outlflow to BAT, without any change in the feeding behavior (Whittle et al.,2012; Contreras et al.,2014).",1
"In contrast to BMP7 and BMP8B, BMP4 was shown to promote the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into white adipocytes, inducing fat storage and decreasing energy expenditure in rodents (Modica and Wolfrum,2013; Contreras et al.,2014).",1
"Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN), a well-known tumor suppressor is a phosphatase that specifically catalyzes the dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-diphosphate PIP2(Cantley and Neel,1999).",1
"This enzyme counteracts the action of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K), resulting in inhibition of the AKT signaling pathway involved in multiple biological processes, including insulin action.",1
"In addition, specific deletion of Pten in the liver in LPTENKO mice induces a strong hepatic steatosis (Stiles et al.,2004; Peyrou et al.,2015), but improves the overall insulin sensitivity, and decreases the fat mass.",1
"Animals were shown to exhibit enhanced insulin sensitivity, while they become obese and to develop insulin resistance a few weeks later, during hibernation, to finally recover their insulin sensitivity upon awakening.",1

Rodents are commonly used to investigate the mechanisms underlying long-term programming of energy balance in the offspring.,1
"High fat feeding of pregnant or lactating mothers was shown to induce glucose intolerance and the development of obesity in the progeny during adult life (Bayol et al.,2008; Samuelsson et al.,2008).",1
"Gestational diabetes in humans is a situation of increased nutrient supply that, together with the high maternal body mass index, can be accompanied by enhanced birth-weight and adverse long-term metabolic consequences, as described by the World Health Organization (2003), as well as in several publications (Larsson et al.,1986; Dabelea et al.,2000; Singh et al.,2006).",1
"It is a well-known hormone increasing BAT activity and inducing â€œbrowningâ€ of WAT via activation of the sympathetic nervous system and resulting increased Î²3 adrenoceptor signaling (Haynes et al.,1997; Commins et al.,2000).",1
"During acute cold exposure, BAT was shown as a significant independent determinant of plasma glucose and HbA1c levels (Matsushita et al.,2014).",1
"Cold-acclimation was also shown to increase diet-induced thermogenesis and postprandial insulin sensitivity, without impacting cold-induced thermogenesis (Lee et al.,2014b).",1
"To this end, one of the very useful tools is the use of rodent strains with different sensitivities to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance.",1
"Indeed, it negatively regulates the energy balance by increasing energy expenditure.",1
"It also secretes several batokines, allowing for inter-organ communication.",1
"Finally, it is easily inducible, such as during mild cold exposure with resulting beneficial effects.",1

Methods\nAn observational analytic cross-sectional study was carried out amongst pregnant women attending selected government health centres in the Buea Health District.,1
We recruited 385 consenting pregnant women for the study.,1
Demographic and clinical data were collected using structured questionnaires.,1
The data was entered into Microsoft Excel and exported toEpi-Info (Version 3.5.1) for analysis.,1
Results\nGeographical accessibility and perceived quality of care were the predominant reasons for choosing or changing a site for ANC.,1
One third of respondents (30.1%) attended a health centre out of their catchment health area with Buea Town health centre receiving the highest proportion of women out of the health area (56.8% of attendees).,1
Knowledge about antenatal care varied and majority of respondents (96.4%) were satisfied with the antenatal services received.,1
ANC coverage in Cameroon in 2007 stood at 82% with 60% of pregnant women having four or more visits [2].,1
Maternal mortality ratio (MMR) has dropped by 47% worldwide during the past 20years.,1
"Methods\nThe cross sectional study was carried out in the Buea Health District, one of the 18 health districts in the South West Region of Cameroon with an estimated population of 86,272 inhabitants [9].",1
Antenatal care services are offered in all the government and in some of the private Health facilities.,1
Nine integrated public health centres which accounted for about two thirds of the total study population were selected as study sites.,1
The health centres are run by senior nurses or midwives (Head of centres) with the exception of Muea health centre which is headed by a medical doctor.,1

"Ethical clearance was obtained from the Faculty of Health Sciencesâ€™ Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Buea, administrative Clearance from the Regional Delegation of Public Health of the South West Region in Buea and from the heads of the different health centres involved in the study.",1
All participants provided written or verbal informed consent.,1
"With the approval from the IRB, pregnant women aged less than the legal age of consent in Cameroon (21 years) and attending antenatal care services were considered emancipated minors and thus allowed to provide consent for themselves.",1
"Apart from the inconvenience of taking time to answer the research questionnaire, participants were not exposed to undue risk.",1
Confidentiality of the respondents was observed by coding questionnaires and the database was password-protected.,1
The women benefitted from knowledge about their care and positive notions about ANC after their interview.,1
Pregnant women who fulfilled the inclusion criteria (pregnant women presenting for the second or subsequent visit) and consented to participate in the study were enrolled into the study.,1
Women presenting for other services than ANC visits were excluded on the grounds that they did not have any experience of a particular health centre and so could not give an opinion on the ANC services.,1
"[""Between 15thNovember 2011 and 15thJuly 2012, a total of 385 women were recruited into the study based on the calculated sample size using the Eng's formula [10] assuming that 50% of the women were satisfied with ANC offered them.""]",1

The mean age of the respondents was 25.2 years (SD 5.1).,1
One third of respondents were single (n=113).,1

"[""Perceptions of pregnant women\nThe respondent's knowledge about ANC was evaluated using three questions.""]",1
Ninety-nine percent (99%) of the respondents affirmed that ANC was important not only for the mother but for the foetus as well.,1
The other two questions concerned the timing of the first visit and the total number of ANC visits.,1
"These responses were compared to the socio-demographic characteristics; marital status, age groups, number of pregnancy (primigravidavs?2 pregnancies), number of visits and educational level (Table 2).",1
Women who had attended antenatal visits in their previous pregnancy thought that it was beneficial to start ANC early in pregnancy unlike those who did not have this experience and who opted for third trimester enrollment.,1
"With respect to health education, the most mentioned topic was â€œhygiene and nutritionâ€ followed by â€œmalaria preventionâ€ (Figure 3).",1
"[""There was no statistical significance observed when respondentsâ€™ maritalstatus and age were compared with the satisfaction of the different services in the health centres using the Fisher's exact test (Table 3).""]",1
"[""Educational level\nThere was insignificant difference using the Fisher's exact test, with regards to all the service ratings when different educational levels were compared (Table 3).""]",1
"Furthermore, they were less satisfied with the comfort in the sitting area and the way the staff attended to them.",1
Overall satisfaction\nMost of the women were satisfied with the care rendered them at the different health centres with 96.9% being â€œvery satisfiedâ€.,1
The overall client satisfaction was compared with the different socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents (Table 4).,1
Some of the respondents (25.6%) were recommended an ANC site.,1
"Of these, 49.6% recommendations were made by friends and neighbors (12.4%) mother or sister (12.4%) and husband (10%).",1
One fifth of the participants were dissatisfied with the amenities that were provided at some of the health institutions.,1
[6] in resource limited settings like the study area.,1
"The topics focused mainly on care in pregnancy (diet, exercise and importance of ANC) and for the newborn (diet and breastfeeding).",1
"The most discussed health topic was hygiene and nutrition in pregnancy like in other studies [4,22].",1
"In our setting, family planning and care of the newborn are usually discussed in Infant Welfare Clinic.",1
The activities carried out in the health centres were similar in the institutions involved in the study.,1
"In a Nigerian study by Fawoleet al [7] and in Entebe, a semi-urban district in Uganda [28] a proportionately similar profile of ANC services were offered as in our area of study.",1
They were impatient because they claimed they had other preoccupations.,1
"Furthermore, respondents had some reservations with respect to the sitting comfort in some health centres, complaining that the benches were too hard and lacked back-rests.",1
There were significant differences between primigravida or multigravida and the educational levels on the aspect of the comprehensiveness of health talks.,1

"Hypothalamic gene expression of feeding-related neuropeptides including neuropeptide Y, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), insulin receptor, leptin receptor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), receptors for dopamine (DopaR1/2/5) and serotonin (SeroR1A/2A/2C), as well as global DNA methylation and brain and plasma folate concentrations were measured at 29 weeks post-weaning.",1
"Results\nHV or HFol pup diets increased brain and plasma folate concentrations and prevented the increase in food intake (5%, P=0.03), body weight (8%, P=0.0006) and glucose response to a glucose load (36%, P=0.02) found in those fed the RV diet.",1
"Expression of anorexigenic POMC (P=0.004) and BDNF (P=0.02) was higher, and DopaR1 was lower (P=0.06) in pups fed the HV diet.",1
Expression of other genes was unaffected.,1
Global DNA methylation was similar among the diet groups.,1
The control group was offspring fed the RV diet and born to dams fed the RV diet.,1
"MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nAnimals and Diets\nFirst-time pregnant Wistar rats (day 2â€“3 of pregnancy) was purchased from Charles River (Montreal, QC, Canada).",1
The dams were housed individually in ventilated plastic transparent cages with bedding in a 12:12 h light-dark cycle (lights on at 0700 at 22 Â± 1 Â°C).,1
Ad libitum access to food and water was provided throughout the study period.,1
The protocol was approved by the University of Toronto Animal Care Committee.,1
"From third day of pregnancy to term, dams (n=10 per gestational diet group) were fed the AIN-93G diet13containing either the RV or HV amount of the multivitamin mix.",1
"The composition (in g/kg) of the RV AIN-93G diet is 529.5 cornstarch, 200 casein, 100 sucrose, 70 soybean oil, 50 cellulose, 10 vitamin mixture, 35 mineral mixture, 3 L-cystine, 2.5 choline bitartarate and 0.014 tert-butyl hydroquinone.",1
"Because 9.75 g of sucrose is added as a carrier in the 10 g of vitamin mix in the RV diet, we reduced the added sucrose to only 10 g in the HV diet to adjust for the 97.5 g of sucrose from the 100 g of vitamin mix.Figure 1adepicts the study design.",1
"Within 24 hours of delivery, each litter was culled to 10 pups to minimize the difference in milk availability.",1
"During lactation, all dams were fed the RV diet.",1
"At weaning, 10 male offspring (one per dam) per gestational diet group were terminated.",1
"All other offspring from dams fed the HV diet were weaned to RV, HV or HFol diets.",1
The RV diet has 2 mg/kg of folate.,1
"Thus, to formulate the 10-fold HFol diet, we added 18 mg of folate to make a total of 20 mg/kg.",1
"The RV, HV and HFol diets were all of the same energy density (3.8 kcal/g).",1
A control group of offspring from dams fed the RV diet was weaned to the RV pup diet for 29 weeks.,1
"Food Intake, Weight Gain and Oral Glucose Tolerance Test\nFigure 1boutlines the study protocol.",1
Food intake over 72 hours was measured every 2 weeks from 0â€“29 weeks post-weaning.,1
"Body weight was measured at birth and weaning, and weight gain was calculated weekly from 0â€“29 weeks post-weaning.",1
"Glucose response to glucose gavage (0.375 g glucose mLâˆ’1, 5 g of glucose per kg body weight) was measured at 18 weeks post-weaning.",1
The rats were fasted overnight for 10 h before glucose gavage.,1
"A blood sample was withdrawn from the tail vein and baseline glucose was immediately assayed using a commercial glucometer (MediSense Precision Xtra, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA).",1
"Upon the glucose gavage, blood glucose concentrations were determined 15 and 60 min later and the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) was calculated.",1
"Tissue Collection\nWhole rat brains were removed rapidly after decapitation at 29 weeks post-weaning and immediately frozen on dry ice, and then stored at âˆ’80 Â°C.",1
The brains were thawed on ice and the right and left sides of the hypothalamus were dissected separately using the method described previously.14The optic chiasma was used as demarcation for the anterior part of the hypothalamus.,1
"This passes through the anterior commissure, which was used as a horizontal limit.",1
The line between the posterior hypothalamus and the mammillary bodies was considered a caudal section.,1
"The dissected hypothalamic blocks contained preoptic, supraoptic, paraventricular, anterior, suprachiasmatic, dorsomedial, ventromedial, arcuate, mammillary, posterior and lateral complex nuclei.",1
The right side of the hypothalamus was used for relative gene expression and the left side for DNA methylation status.,1
The left side of the remaining brain was used for folate concentration measurement.,1
"Trunk blood was collected and centrifuged, and plasma samples were added with 0.5% ascorbic acid to prevent folate oxidation.",1
"Hypothalamic Gene Expression\nEach dissected hypothalamus was homogenized using a tissue ruptor homogenizer (Qiagen Tech., Mississauga, ON, Canada).",1
"The RNA from the homogenized samples was isolated using Trizol reagent and chloroform extraction by the manufacturerâ€™s protocol (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) and quantified by Nanodrop 1000.",1
"The cDNA was synthesized using the High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit in the ABI (Applied Biosystems Inc, Foster City, CA, USA) Gene Amp PCR System 2700.",1
"Real-time RT-PCR was performed on the ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System (SDS) using Taqman assays for the following genes purchased from ABI (Foster City, CA, USA): neuropeptide Y (NPY; Cat# Rn01410146_m1); pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC; Cat# Rn00595020_m1); insulin receptor (InsR; Cat# Rn00567070_m1); leptin receptor (LepR; Cat# Rn01433205_m1); brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; Cat# Rn02531967_s1); dopamine receptor 1 (DopaR1; Cat# Rn03062203_s1); dopamine receptor 2 (DopaR2; Cat# Rn00561126_m1); dopamine receptor 5 (DopaR5; Cat# Rn00562768_s1); serotonin receptor 1A (SeroR1A; Cat# Rn00561409_s1); serotonin receptor 2A (SeroR2A; Cat# Rn01468302_m1); serotonin receptor 2C (SeroR2C; Cat# Rn00562748_m1).",1
"The cycle conditions were 50 Â°C for 2 minutes, 95 Â°C for 10 minutes, 40 cycles for 95 Â°C for 15 seconds, and 60 Â°C for 1 minute.",1
"The relative quantification method was performed using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Cat# Rn99999916_s1) as an endogenous control, which was selected based on a preliminary screen for its lowest variation.",1
"Results were expressed as fold-change by the 2âˆ’Î”Î”CTmethod15and analyzed using ABI DataAssist software version 3.0 (Foster City, CA, USA).",1
"Folate Concentration Analysis\nPlasma and brain folate concentrations were determined by the microbiological microtiter plate assay using Lactobacillus casei .16,17\n\nHypothalamic Global DNA Methylation Analysis\nDNA was isolated using the protocol outlined by the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen Tech., Mississauga, ON, Canada).",1
"Two spectrophotometric readings of the DNA samples were averaged to determine the concentration, which had a ratio of A260to A280between 1.8 and 2.0 and was free of RNA and protein contamination.",1
"Global methylation status of hypothalamic genomic DNA was determined by the in vitro methyl acceptance assay method as described previously.18,19This assay involves3H-methyl-S-adenosylmethionine (New England Nuclear, Boston, MA, USA) as a methyl donor mediated by Sss1 DNA methyltransferase (New England Biolabs, Pickering, ON, Canada).",1
All samples were run in duplicates and the entire assay was performed twice.,1
The intra- and inter-assay CV were 5%.,1
"Statistical Analyses\nTreatment effects on weight gain and 72 h food intake were analyzed using the PROC MIXED model procedure in SAS (Version 9.2, SAS Institute Inc., Carey, NC, USA) with gestational diets, pup diets and time as the main factors.",1
"The means at each time point and for hypothalamic gene expression, folate status and glucose response were compared by one-way analysis of variance using the PROC GLM followed by a Tukeyâ€™s post-hoc test.",1
Significant differences were reported at P<0.05.,1
All data are expressed as means Â± standard error of means (SEM).,1
"RESULTS\n\nFood Intake, Weight Gain and Glucose Response\nThere was no difference in body weight at birth and weaning between the offspring born to dams on the HV diet compared to those born to dams on a RV diet.",1
"Male offspring from the HV dams weaned to the RV diet had 5% higher 72 h food intake (Diet: P=0.03, Time: P<0.0001, Diet*Time Interaction: P=0.4), 8% higher weight gain (Diet: P=0.0006, Time: P<0.0001, Diet*Time Interaction: P=0.3) and 36% higher glucose response to glucose gavage (P=0.02) compared to those from the RV dams at 29 weeks post-weaning (Figure 2,3,4).",1
There was no effect of the gestational or pup diets on hypothalamic expression of other genes.,1
Global Methylation Status\nNeither the gestational nor post-weaning diet had any effect on the global methylation status in the offspring at 29 weeks post-weaning (Figure 6c).,1
Feeding the HV pup diet restored POMC and BDNF expression to control levels in mature offspring.,1

The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression scale was used to evaluate depression scores.,1
A total of 169 participants were assigned to the two groups of placebo and vitamin D through block randomization design.,1
Vitamin D group received 2000\xa0IU vitamin D3daily from 26 to 28 weeks of gestation until childbirth.,1
Maternal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were measured at baseline and childbirth.,1
"Besides, depression scores were evaluated four times: at 26â€“28 and 38â€“40 weeks of gestation, and finally at 4 and 8 weeks after birth.",1
"At baseline, no correlation was observed between 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and depression score ( r \u2009=\u20090.13, p \u2009=\u20090.09).",1

"In human body, the most important source of vitamin D is the skin where 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to vitamin D3in response to UV exposure.",1
Both cutaneous production and dietary consumption of vitamin D must undergo two hydroxylations in the body for activation.,1
"Following the first hydroxylation in the liver, 25-hydroxyvitamin D is produced.",1
"However, 25-hydroxyvitamin D requires an additional hydroxylation in the kidneys to form the biologically active form of vitamin D, 1, 25(OH) 2D.",1
"Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D as the main precursor of 1, 25(OH) 2D has a circulating half-life of 2â€“3 weeks.",1
"The special nuclear receptors for 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D and also essential enzymes for hydroxylation of vitamin D are found in the central nervous system.",1
Depression scores were measured three days after childbirth using a questionnaire based on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression scale (EPDS) [33].,1
"Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were measured in 4,236 pregnant mothers around their 13\xa0weeks of gestation and their depression scores were measured at 16\xa0weeks.",1
"In this study, they selected mothers who needed antidepressant drugs after childbirth as the case group.",1
The mothers who were not on antidepressant drugs were selected as the control group.,1
"Methods\n\nSetting and participants\nThis randomized clinical trial was done in pregnant women who were under prenatal care in Hafez hospital which is a tertiary hospital in Shiraz, Iran, affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.",1
Nulliparous and multiparous pregnant women were entered into this study.,1
"The inclusion criteria were: being 18\xa0years or older, healthy women means; any one with no history of mental illness and internal diseases such as hyper/hypothyroidism, parathyroid, renal, diabetes and heart diseases, no addiction to any kind of narcotic drugs, living with a husband, a singleton live fetus, without any pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, ruptured membranes and suspicion of preterm birth, no previous cesarean sections, gestational age of 26â€“28 weeks based on ultrasound results, and the EPDS baseline scores of 0 to 13.",1
"Exclusion Criteria were: the participants with the EPDS baseline scores of >13, not providing blood sample at the onset of the study, and less than 8\xa0weeks consumption of vitamin D3supplementations (for example due to preterm labor or stopping consumption), irregular consumption (for example every two/three days instead of daily consumption).",1
"In this study, data collection lasted from November 2014 until early October 2015.",1
The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences with the ethics code 93â€“7212.,1
"Also, the present study has been recorded in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trialsâ€™ website with the code number IRCT2015020310327N11.",1
"Data collection tools\nIn this study, we used the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression scale (EPDS) in order to evaluate depression levels.",1
"This questionnaire is comprised of ten multiple choice questions, the minimum score is 0 and the maximum is 30.",1
The EPDS was originally utilized in the postpartum period only.,1
"It was translated to Persian and was used in the study by Mazhari and Nakhaee, with a validity and reliability of 0.76 and 0.83, respectively [42].",1
Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was measured with the Chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) method [45].,1
"After separating the serum from blood sample, the serum was kept under âˆ’20\xa0Â°C temperature until the laboratory test was done.",1
The vitamin D measurements were all done in one laboratory in Shiraz.,1
The lab technicians were blind to group allocations.,1
"Design and data collection\nAt first, a research team member who was responsible for data collection visited the prenatal care clinic of the hospital daily and based on the inclusion criteria, invited the mothers to participate in the study.",1
She clarified the studyâ€™s goals and if the mothers were willing to participation a written informed consent was obtained from them.,1
The maternal baseline depression levels were evaluated.,1
The mothers with depression score of 0â€“13 were entered in the study.,1
"Finally, the candidates were referred to the lab in order to provide blood samples for determining serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations.",1
The pills were produced by the Jalinous pharmaceutical company in Iran.,1
The consumptions of pills were assessed in later prenatal care visits and over the phone.,1
"Maternal blood samples were obtained at 26â€“28 weeks of gestation (at baseline) and once more, at childbirth (during first 24\xa0h after birth in postpartum ward).",1
"Depression scores were determined four times: at 26â€“28 weeks of gestation (baseline), at 38â€“40 weeks of gestation, and finally at 4 and 8 weeks after birth.",1
This group also received routine prenatal care.,1
Intervention in the control group: the control group received two placebo pills composed of starch daily from 26 to 28 weeks.,1
"Also, other study protocol measures for this group were similar to the vitamin D group.",1
In order not to deprive the participants from antenatal supplements all participating mothers were allowed to use prescribed supplementation outside this studyâ€™s protocol.,1
Stratified random sampling was performed in this study.,1
Nulliparous and multiparous mothers were considered as the strata.,1
"In the strata, each eligible pregnant woman was assigned in the control or the vitamin D groups using block randomization strategy.",1
The data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical software (v. 16).,1
"Besides, P -values\u2009<\u20090.05 were considered as statistically significant.",1
The normality of the data was evaluated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.,1
The means of normal distribution data were analyzed using parametric tests such as Studentâ€™s t -test or paired t- test.,1
A non parametric test (Mann Whitney U test) was used whenever the continuous measures were not normally distributed.,1
The distribution of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration at baseline and childbirth was not normal in the all participants.,1
"Therefore, a nonparametric test was used for 25-hydroxyvitamin D data.",1
"And in order to determine changes over time, the repeated measures analysis was used.",1
Correlations between continuous.,1
This was a single-blind study.,1
"Data collection related to depression, at 38â€“40 weeks of gestation, at 4 and 8 weeks after birth were done by a trained midwife outside the research team.",1
She was blind to group allocations.,1
"Results\nIn this trial study, first 250 pregnant mothers were interviewed.",1
"Out of which, 184 qualified mothers were selected who completed the baseline depression questionnaire.",1
"Amongst them, 15 mothers leaved the study, because their depression scores were higher than 13.",1
"The Remaining 169 participants were assigned to the control or vitamin D groups with a block randomization design, and they were referred to the laboratory to provide blood sample.",1

PubMed Central:,1
"Epigenetics encompasses the mechanisms that regulate gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence, and the complete epigenetic status of a cell at any given time is termed the epigenome.",1
"Epigenetic programing is fundamental for normal mammalian development, and provides a more subtle mechanism by which the environment can rapidly alter gene expression within single or multiple generations.",1
"As such, testing procedures and safety guidelines are in place to protect human health against the adverse effects of environmentally induced genetic mutations.",1
"For this purpose, we searched the current literature on epigenetic mechanisms involved in the mammalian life cycle and environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity in human epidemiological cohorts and rodent models in PubMed using the terms in Supplementary Table 1; defining environmentally induced epigenetic toxicity as environmental factors (chemicals, radiation and lifestyle factors (including alcohol, nutrition and smoking)) that induce adverse effects (growth retardation, fertility problems, hormonal changes, reproductive and/or other organ- and system-specific abnormalities (including immune disorders, obesity, diabetes and cancer)) and are associated with epigenetic mechanisms (histone modifications, DNA methylation, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and other epigenetic machinery (DNA/RNA binding and modifying proteins)).",1
Relevant papers were selected based on the inclusion criteria in Supplementary Table 1.,1
"Epigenetic mechanisms\nHistones are a family of highly conserved, small, basic (positively charged) proteins around which (negatively charged) DNA winds to form nucleosomes, the main structural units of chromatin (the protein-DNA complex) that enable DNA to be packaged into the nucleus (Kornberg & Lorch1999).",1
"Both the tails and globular domains of histones can undergo multiple posttranslational modifications, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ADP ribosylation, ubiquitination and sumoylation, giving rise to the so-called histone code (Strahl & Allis2000; Turner2000; Jenuwein & Allis2001; Bhaumik et\xa0al.2007; Kouzarides2007; Suganuma & Workman2011).",1
"The functional groups are added or removed by a range of enzymes: acetylases, methyltransferases, kinases, ADP ribosyltransferases, ubiquitin ligases, sumo ligases; and deacteylases, demethylases, phosphatases, ADP ribosyl hydrolases, deubiquitinases, sumo deconjugating enzymes, respectively (Wang & Dasso2009; Khare et\xa0al.2012).",1
These modifications alter the interaction between DNA and DNA binding proteins (such as transcription factors and RNA polymerases) so that it is the overall combined effect of the histone code that determines an active or repressive chromatin structure and thus regulates gene expression.,1
"In general, histone acetylation and demethylation are associated with active chromatin (euchromatin), while histone deacteylation and methylation are associated with repressive chromatin (heterochromatin).",1
"DNA methylation involves the addition of a methyl group, primarily to the C5 of cytosine within cytosineâ€“phosphateâ€“guanine dinucelotides (CpGs) to produce 5-methylcytosine (5mC).",1
"Due to the high mutagenic potential of 5mC to spontaneously deaminate to thymine, the mammalian genome is largely depleted of CpGs (Bird1980; Bird & Taggart1980), with the exception of distinct regions known as CpG islands (CGIs) (Bird et\xa0al.1985).",1
"These CpG rich CGIs are non-randomly distributed throughout the mammalian genome, being predominantly associated with regulatory elements such as promoters (Deaton & Bird2011).",1
DNA methylation also alters the interaction between DNA and DNA binding proteins to regulate gene expression.,1
"DNA is methylated by a family of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) (Bestor & Ingram1983; Li et\xa0al.1992, 1996; Okano et\xa0al.1998,1999; Aapola et\xa0al.2000; Gowher et\xa0al.2005).",1
"DNMT1, the maintenance DNMT, preferentially methylates hemimethylated DNA and thus maintains DNA methylation following DNA replication.",1
"De novo methylation is established by the de novo DNMTs 3A and 3B, which preferentially methylate unmethylated DNA.",1
"The third member of the DNMT3 family, DNMT3L, does not possess any DNMT activity, but can help to recruit, and stimulate the activity of, DNMT3A and 3B.",1
"The ncRNA superfamily encompasses a number of families broadly classified according to their length: long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (>200\u2009nt) and short non coding RNAs (sncRNAs) (<200\u2009nt), which include microRNAs (miRNAs, single stranded, âˆ¼19â€“25\u2009nt), piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs, single stranded, âˆ¼24â€“30\u2009nt) and endogenous short interfering RNAs (esiRNAs, double stranded, âˆ¼21â€“22\u2009nt).",1
"The vast majority of the mammalian genome is composed of so-called non-coding DNA (ncDNA), with only 1â€“5% coding for proteins.",1
"Prokaryote genomes contain only 10% ncDNA, more complex fungi and animals >50%, rising to >98% in complex mammals (including mice and humans) (Carey2011).",1
"NcDNA is transcribed into ncRNAs, which play major roles in regulating gene expression.",1
"While lncRNAs do this in a variety of ways, including chromosome remodeling, and transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation (Galupa & Heard2015; Kanduri2016; Taylor et\xa0al.2015), sncRNAs predominantly mediate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level (Cook & Blelloch2013; Hale et\xa0al.2014).",1
"In general, miRNAs repress gene expression by binding to mRNAs in a sequence-specific manner and either inducing their degradation or inhibiting their translation (Ivey & Srivastava2015), whereas piRNAs and esiRNAs bind to complementary transposable elements (TEs) and induce their degradation (Watanabe et\xa0al.2006,2008).",1
"Thus, miRNAs are involved in fine tuning gene expression, whilst piRNAs and esiRNAs play a primary role in maintaining genome stability.",1
Role of epigenetics in the mammalian life cycle\nNormal mammalian development is a cyclical series of events that enable the continued production of multiple generations (described in Gilbert2014).,1
A new generation begins with the fusion of the male (spermatozoa) and female (oocyte) gametes (fertilization) to produce a single cell (zygote) containing one haploid female pronucleus and one haploid male pronucleus.,1
All the different cell types that comprise the new individual develop from this zygote and so contain the same unique genome.,1
"To enable de-differentiation of the highly specialized mature male and female gametes and subsequent generation of multiple specialized cell types capable of performing a wide range of diverse functions, these genomes require differential modifications so that functionally relevant genes can be switched on/off.",1
This is achieved through epigenetic re-programing and programing.,1
"Thus, throughout development, epigenetic processes regulate the expression and silencing of specific genes to drive the mammalian life cycle.",1
"Two key global epigenetic re-programing and programing events occur, one after fertilization in the early embryo in all cells, and the second in germ cells only during primordial germ cell (PGC) development (Figure 1).",1
Caption (FIG): FIGURE 1.,1
Epigenetics and the mammalian life cycle.,1
"Following fertilization epigenetic marks are removed to generate a totipotent zygote, capable of producing all the different cell types required to form a new individual.",1
Re-establishment of new epigenetic marks then redirects and drives development of the zygote through embryogenesis and ultimately into a mature adult.,1
"Primordial germ cells (PGCs) undergo a second epigenetic re-programing and programing to ensure correct imprinting and development of mature germ cells according to the gender of the embryo, and enable the successful production of subsequent generations in a continuous cycle.",1
"The first re-programing event immediately following fertilization de-differentiates the mature parental gametes so that the resulting zygote becomes totipotent, capable of producing all the different cell types required to form a new individual.",1
This involves global DNA demethylation and changes in histone modifications and non-coding RNA expression to effectively â€˜resetâ€™ the zygote epigenome and thus genome.,1
"Epigenetic programing via DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs then redirects and drives development of the zygote through embryogenesis and ultimately into a mature adult.",1
The dynamics of this first re-programing and programing event are particularly well highlighted by the functional switching of sncRNAs from a focus on guarding the genome to guiding development.,1
"The early zygote has low levels of miRNAs, but high expression of piRNAs and esiRNAs, with esiRNAs being the predominate species (Garcia-Lopez et\xa0al.2015).",1
"As early development progresses and the embryonic genome is activated, miRNA expression increases and piRNA and esiRNA expression decreases, so that the pattern of sncRNA expression is reversed (Ohnishi et\xa0al.2010; Suh & Blelloch2011).",1
"Immediately following fertilization the quiescent embryo genome requires protection, hence higher expression of piRNAs and esiRNAs, both of which are involved in maintaining genome stability (Watanabe et\xa0al.2006,2008).",1
"Once transcription within the embryo genome is activated, however, there is rapid cell proliferation and differentiation, processes for which miRNA-mediated regulation is essential (Ivey & Srivastava2015), hence increased expression of miRNAs.",1
"The continued transcriptional silencing of such regions is essential for early embryogenesis and genome stability, respectively.",1
"Normal embryo development requires a maternal and paternal contribution, generation of uniparental embryos by pronuclear transplantation results in developmental failure (Barton et\xa0al.1984; McGrath & Solter1984).",1
"This is because the male and female pronuclei are differentially imprinted; that is certain genes carry a parent-of-origin epigenetic mark so that they are only expressed from a single parental allele, ensuring the correct dosage of maternally and paternally derived gene products (reviewed in Bartolomei & Ferguson-Smith2011).",1
Imprinted genes are generally widely and highly expressed during prenatal development and predominantly down-regulated after birth.,1
The second re-programing and programing event involves PGCs only.,1
A female must reprogram the paternally imprinted genes on the chromosomes inherited from her father into maternally imprinted genes and vice versa .,1
"Thus, PGCs undergo a second round of global demethylation and changes in histone modification and non-coding RNA expression, this time including removal of the parent-specific imprints.",1
"Once again some of the most active TEs also escape this second phase of epigenetic re-programing, thereby maintaining genome stability.",1
(2015) and Leseva et\xa0al.,1
(2016).,1
"Following sex determination, epigenetic programing via DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs redirect and drive differentiation of the PGCs along the distinct spermatozoal or oocyte lineage.",1
"Like the early zygote, mature gametes are transcriptionally quiescent.",1
"Indeed, PGCs, which represent an interim stage of the developing germ line that requires miRNA-mediated proliferation and differentiation with some pi/esiRNA-mediated genome protection, express greater levels of miRNAs and reduced levels of piRNAs and esiRNAs compared with the mature gametes and early zygote (Garcia-Lopez et\xa0al.2015).",1
"Ultimately, the mature gametes come together to enable the cycle to begin again and so on.",1
The different epigenetic pathways converge and interact to regulate gene expression at multiple levels (Figure 2).,1
"This combination of interactive pathways helps to confer efficiency, redundancy, robustness and fidelity onto epigenetic re-programing/programing during development, and thus the successful and continued production of multiple generations.",1
Caption (FIG): FIGURE 2.,1
Epigenetic regulation of gene expression.,1
"A range of epigenetic processes including DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), (such as long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and endogenous short interfering RNAs (esiRNAs)) form an efficient and robust complex interactive network that regulates gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.",1
Inhibitory processes are shown in red and positive in green.,1
Both histone modifications and DNA methylation changes can inhibit or promote transcription of mRNAs and ncRNAs.,1
"ncRNAs can then inhibit the production of protein from mRNAs either via mRNA degradation and/or reduced translation, and/or protect genome stability via the degradation of transposable elements (retrotransposons).",1
"Some ncRNAs can also promote changes in DNA methylation, histone modifications, and/or the expression of other ncRNAs.",1
"To complete the network, DNA/RNA binding and modifying proteins can both inhibit or promote gene expression whilst their own expression is under the control of the DNA modifications and ncRNAs they promote and/or interact with.",1
"For example, certain metals and environmental chemicals can directly bind and alter the activity of DNMTs, TETs and histone modifiers (Chervona & Costa2012; Hou et\xa0al.2012; Wang & Wang2013; Ruiz-Hernandez et\xa0al.2015).",1
"Poor nutrition (reduced folate), detoxification of arsenic and consumption of glutathione during the detoxification of reactive oxygen species can all lead to reduced levels of the DNMT co-substrate S -adenosylmethionine (Hou et\xa0al.2012; Ruiz-Hernandez et\xa0al.2015).",1
"Similarly, histone acetylases require the co-substrate acetyl-CoA, and altered glycolytic production of acetyl-CoA can lead to changes in histone acetylation (Wellen et\xa0al.2009; Moussaieff et\xa0al.2015).",1
"Endocrine disrupting chemicals can bind to nuclear receptors, and either directly induce activity altering modifications to the epigenetic machinery (such as histone methyl transferases); or act as transcription factors, binding to hormone-responsive promotor elements and promoting expression of ncRNAs and/or epigenetic machinery (Kabir et\xa0al.2015; Trevino et\xa0al.2015).",1
Environmental factors and epigenetic perturbation\nEpigenetic processes are susceptible to perturbation throughout an individualâ€™s life (Figure 1).,1
"This represents an adulthood exposure to the parent, but a very early life exposure to the offspring.",1
"As mentioned earlier, there are a number of loci within PGCs that escape the two global DNA demethylation re-programing events.",1
"In addition, not all of the spermatozoal histones are replaced with protamines during spermiogenesis, up to 15% of histones within human spermatozoa and 1% in mouse spermatozoa are retained (Miller et\xa0al.2010; Carrell2012).",1

"Case report\nA 12-week-pregnant 35-year-old woman presented with an approximately 4-week history of a growing, tender papule under her right great toenail.",1
She initially noticed nail discoloration; then she reported progressively worsening discomfort with lifting of her nail plate.,1
"She denied any other medical problems, denied any medications other than prenatal vitamins, and reported no complications with her pregnancy.",1
"Four weeks later, once she was well into the second trimester of her pregnancy, a\xa0shave removal with electrodessication of the base\xa0was performed after reflecting the nail plate proximally to expose the lesion.",1
The patient subsequently returned 8\xa0weeks postprocedure reporting evidence of recurrence that began approximately 2\xa0weeks prior.,1
"On evaluation of this recurrence, a 0.8- Ã— 0.9-cm friable erythematous papule was noted under the onycholytic distal right great toenail and extended distal to the onychodermal band (Fig 1).",1
"Using a nail splitter, the nail plate was vertically cut and reflected proximally to completely visualize the lesion.",1
A deeper shave removal was performed with aggressive electrodessication of the base to minimize risk of recurrence.,1
The nail plate was subsequently reflected back into place.,1
Histopathologic examination found an inflammatory crust covering an ulceration that consisted of a dense proliferation of capillaries and endothelial cells in the dermis (Fig 2).,1
The capillaries were not arranged in lobules and rather were dispersed among spicules of mineralized bone.,1
The spicules of bone\xa0contained osteocytes and were lined by benign-appearing osteoblasts (Fig 3).,1
"Discussion\nClinically, AAOC appears as a friable erythematous exophytic papule on digits, palms, or soles and can develop at any age with slight female predominance.",1
It closely resembles other benign lesions such as PG.,1
The distinguishing feature of AAOC is that the capillary formation is not lobular as seen in PG but rather a diffuse pattern.,1
Histologically in AAOC the diffuse capillary formations have spicules of woven bones dispersed.,1
No lamellar bone or cartilage is seen.,1
AAOC can also mimic other benign growths.,1
"Subungual exostosis usually presents as a growth under the nail, causing onycholysis.",1
"However, subungual exostosis has a fibrous cap and lacks capillary proliferation.",1
Peripheral ossifying fibroma resembles PG clinically but occurs exclusively in the gingiva.,1
"Although peripheral ossifying fibroma exhibits features of vascular proliferation and ossification, it mostly contains fibroblasts and stroma.",1
Surgical removal of AAOC is the treatment of choice.,1
Thirteen of 14 cases had no documented recurrence.,1
"In our patient, the lesion did not recur after the second surgical removal after 6\xa0months of observation.",1

"Materials and methods\n\nEthics statement\nExperimental procedures with animals were carried out following with the recommendations of the European Communities directive 2010/63/EU and Spanish legislation (Real Decreto 53/2013, BOE 34/11370-11421, 2013) regulating the care and use of laboratory animals.",1
The protocol was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Complutense University of Madrid.,1
"Animals, housing, mating, and feeding\nAdolescent female Wistar rats (Harlan, Barcelona, Spain) weighing 191.7 Â± 2.6 g were individually housed in standard cages and maintained in controlled room conditions at 21 Â± 1Â°C room temperature, 40 Â± 5% relative humidity and a 12-h light-dark cycle (lights off 8:00 p. m.).",1
Animals were handled and allowed to acclimate for at least 4 weeks before the diet assignation.,1
"Then, 2 weeks before mating (Figure1), animals were weighed (average weight 240.7 Â± 3.4 g) and randomly exposed to an ad libitum access of a standard chow (control group; n = 9) or a restricted access of the same standard chow (caloric restriction group; n = 15).",1
"The females with caloric restriction were fed with a daily amount of food corresponding to the 80% of the calories that the control rats were fed in the previous day of the experiment, according to the body weight (20% of caloric restriction).",1
"The standard chow (Standard Chow SAFE A04, Panlab, Barcelona, Spain) contained 16.1% of protein, 60% carbohydrate, 3.1% fat, 4% fiber, and 0.0025% sodium, resulting in a 2.9 kcal/g as energy.",1
Caption (FIG): FIGURE 1\n\nExperimental design .,1
Two weeks before mating female rats were exposed to 20% caloric restriction up to the gestational day 20 (GD20).,1
Body weight and caloric intake of offspring were monitored from birth (PND0) to adulthood (postnatal weeks 21â€“23).,1
Feeding behavior (compulsive feeding and feeding response to AM251) was evaluated at adolescence (postnatal weeks 8â€“9) and adulthood (postnatal weeks 12â€“13).,1
"After 2 weeks of feeding (pregestational period), adult females (4 month old) were allowed to mate with male rats of the same strain weighting 484.5 Â± 7.96 (Figure1).",1
"The presence of plug or spermatozoa in the vaginal smear confirmed the successful mating, and this was designated as gestational day 0 (GD 0).",1
Female rats were maintained on the same diet paradigm as in the pregestational period up to the gestational day 20 (GD 20).,1
"Thus, the caloric restriction finished at GD 20 (2 days before birth), and all dams and their offspring were fed ad libitum with the standard chow along the remaining experimental periods (lactation and postweaning periods).",1
The day of birth was defined as postnatal day 0 (PND 0).,1
"Within the 14 h after birth, pups were weighed, sexed, and culled to comprise up to 8 pups per mother (4 males and 4 females where possible).",1
"Food intake and body weight of the dams and pups were 3â€“4 days per week and/or weekly measured along lactation and post-weaning periods (infancy, adolescence, and adulthood).",1
"At PND 22â€“23, offspring were weaned, housed in groups (2â€“3 rats/cage) according to the litter and fed ad libitum with the same standard chow.",1
Dams were sacrificed.,1
Feeding behavior tests in the offspring were carried out at the adolescence (postnatal weeks 8â€“9) and the adulthood (postnatal weeks 12â€“13).,1
"At the postnatal weeks 21â€“23, adult offspring were finally weighted and sacrificed (Figure1).",1
"Moreover, males were housed in a separate room.",1
We generated the following four experimental groups: Male offspring from control diet-fed dams (CC male; n = 15); Male offspring from calorie-restricted dams (RC male; n = 23); Female offspring from control diet-fed dams (CC female; n = 16); and Female offspring from calorie-restricted dams (RC female; n = 23).,1
"The criteria described by Vickers were adopted to refer to different stages of development (Vickers et al.,2000).",1
Measurement of caloric intake\nFood intake was determined by subtracting the amount of food left in the cage from the total amount of food provided.,1
"To calculate individual food intake when animals were housed in groups, total food intake from each cage was measured and equally divided according to the number of pups per cage.",1
Comparisons among groups were performed by calculating cumulative caloric intake relative to body weight (kcal/kg) at each time point.,1
Compulsive feeding test\nThis test was an adaptation of the Compulsive Feeding Test described by Heyne et al.,1
(2009).,1
"To assess the feeding behavior, rats were exposed to a free choice between a mixture of chocolates and a standard chow for limited and unlimited time.",1
"This test allows us to measure food intake, chocolate preference as well as to detect the development of inflexible feeding behavior.",1
"At the beginning of the test, the rats were individually housed and exposed to the two types of food (chocolate and standard chow) for 4 days.",1
"Rats had ad libitum access to the standard chow and water, and had limited access to the chocolate for 1 h during the light phase.",1
The position of chocolate mixture was switched every day.,1
"At the end of the test, animals were returned to their original cages and standard diet.",1
Total caloric intake relative to body weight and chocolate preference (calculated as the percentage of chocolate eaten on overall intake) were evaluated at adolescence (postnatal weeks 8â€“9) and reevaluated at adulthood (postnatal weeks 12â€“13) in all experimental groups.,1
"Test of feeding response to AM251\nTo evaluate the implication of the cannabinoid CB1 receptors in the differential response on caloric intake and chocolate preference, adult rats (postnatal weeks 13â€“14) were firstly treated with a dose of the CB1 receptor inverse agonist AM251 (3 mg/kg) and then exposed to a free choice between a mixture of chocolates and a standard chow.",1
"AM251 (Tocris, Bioscence, Bristol, UK) was dissolved in a vehicle containing 5% Tween 80 and 95% saline.",1
"The day before the test, all animals were food-deprived for 20 h. Then AM251 or vehicle was intraperitoneally administered (3 mg/mL).",1
"After 30 min, animals were placed in an individual cage without bedding material.",1
"Then, they were provided with two small cans containing both types of food that were previously weighed.",1
Chocolate and total caloric intakes relative to body weight (kcal/kg) were calculated for 4 h. We generated the following eight experimental offspring groups: Vehicle in CC male ( n = 7); AM251 in CC male ( n = 8); Vehicle in RC male ( n = 9); AM251 in RC male ( n = 10); Vehicle in CC female ( n = 6); AM251 in CC female ( n = 7); Vehicle in RC female ( n = 11); and AM251 in RC female ( n = 11).,1
"Sample collection\nAt 21â€“23 postnatal weeks, adult offspring were sacrificed by decapitation after the administration of EquitesinÂ® (3 mg/kg).",1
This process was carried out in the 2 following hours after the beginning of the dark phase in a separate room from the other experimental animals.,1
Blood samples were briefly collected into tubes containing EDTA (6%) and centrifuged (1500 g for 10 min at 4Â°C).,1
"The plasma was removed, frozen and stored at âˆ’80Â°C for biochemical and hormonal analysis.",1
"White perirenal and perigonadal fat were completely dissected out, weighed, frozen, and stored at âˆ’80Â°C until RT-qPCR analyses.",1
The weights of the individual fat depots were used to determine total body fat mass.,1
"Liver samples and the brains were also collected, frozen and stored at âˆ’80Â°C.",1
"Then, the hypothalamus was dissected out from the base of the brain according the rat brain atlas of Paxinos and Watson (2007).",1
"Measurement of metabolites, hepatic enzymes, and leptin in plasma\nThe following plasma metabolites and enzymes were measured: basal glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), urea, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALKP), and the hepatic enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (Î³GT).",1

"Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) were estimated following the Friedewald equation (Warnick et al.,1990) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was determined by the modification of Friedewal equation proposed by Ahmadi et al.",1
(2008): VLDL = TG/5; LDL = [(TChol/1.19)+(TG/1.9)âˆ’(HDL/1.1)âˆ’38].,1
The plasma levels of leptin were measured using a commercial rat leptin ELISA kit (Cat.,1
no.,1
"RD291001200R; BioVendor, Brno, Czech Republic).",1
Measurement of adiposity\nAdiposity was estimated by calculating the percentage of abdominal fat weight over total body weight.,1
The sum of the total deposits of perirenal and perigonadal fat determines the amount of abdominal fat.,1
"RNA isolation and real-time quantitative PCR analysis\nWe performed real-time qPCR (TaqMan, Life Technologies) as described previously (Decara et al.,2012).",1

"Methods\n\nParticipants\nThe Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a population-based birth cohort that recruited 14\u200a541 predominantly white pregnant women resident in Avon, UK with expected dates of delivery from April 1, 1991 to December 31, 1992.",1
These pregnancies resulted in 13\u200a972 singleton or twin children who were alive at 1\u2005year of age.,1
"The cohort has been followed since birth with annual questionnaires and, since age 7\u2005years, with objective measures in annual research clinics.",1
"The study protocol has been described previously [11,12] and further information can be found atwww.alspac.bris.ac.uk, which contains details of all the data that are available (www.bris.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-access/data-dictionary/).",1
Ethics approval was obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee (IRB 00003312) and the Local National Health Service Research Ethics Committees.,1
"Exposure assessment\nData on maternal diet in pregnancy were collected by a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at 32\u2005weeks gestation, covering all the main foods consumed in Britain [13].",1
The questionnaire asked about their current weekly frequency of consumption of 43 food groups and food items.,1
"More detailed questions were asked about daily consumption of a further eight basic foods (including sugar, coffee and tea).",1
Free sugar does not include lactose when naturally present in milk and milk products or the sugars contained within the cellular structure of fruits and vegetables.,1
"[""Information on the child's free sugar consumption at age 3\u2005years, as well as maternal and paternal sugar consumption at 4\u2005years post-partum, was collected by a similar FFQ.""]",1
"Information from a questionnaire at recruitment and from the obstetric records was used to classify women into four mutually exclusive categories: no evidence of glycosuria or diabetes, existing diabetes mellitus before the pregnancy, gestational diabetes and persistent glycosuria during pregnancy.",1
For the purposes of analysis we combined the last three categories to create a binary maternal â€œdiabetesâ€ variable (see supplementary material for further details).,1
"Outcome assessment\n\nBinary variables\nCurrent doctor-diagnosed asthma was defined in children at age 7.5\u2005years (primary outcome) if mothers responded positively to the question â€œHas a doctor ever actually said that your study child has asthma?â€ and to one or both of the questions â€œHas your child had any of the following in the past 12\u2005months: wheezing with whistling; asthma?â€\nCurrent wheezing, eczema and hay fever in children at age 7.5\u2005years were defined by a positive answer to the question: â€œHas your child had any of the following in the past 12\u2005months: wheezing with whistling; eczema; hay fever?â€\nAtopy at age 7\u2005years was defined as a positive reaction (maximum diameter of any detectable weal) to Dermatophagoidespteronyssinus , cat or grass (after subtracting positive saline reactions from histamine and allergen weals, and excluding children unreactive to 1% histamine).",1
"Categorical variables\nChildren were further classified, post hoc , according to their asthmatic/atopic status, thus defining a four-category variable (no atopy or asthma, atopy only, nonatopic asthma and atopic asthma), and according to their number of positive reactions to cat, grass and dust mite allergens (n=0, 1 and â‰¥2).",1
"[""Data on child's asthma status at age 7 and 14\u2005years were used to derive asthma status phenotypes between age 7 and 14\u2005years (none, remitting, incident and persisting) [16].""]",1
"Continuous variables\nSerum total IgE (kUÂ·Lâˆ’1) was measured by fluoroimmunoassay using the Pharmacia UNICAP system (Pharmacia and Upjohn Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden).",1
"Lung function was measured by spirometry (Vitalograph 2120; Vitalograph, Maids Moreton, UK) at age 8.5\u2005years after withholding short-acting bronchodilators for at least 6\u2005h and long-acting bronchodilators and theophyllines for at least 24\u2005h. The best of three reproducible flowâ€“volume curves was used to measure forced expiratory volume in 1\u2005s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and maximal mid-expiratory flow (forced expiratory flow at 25â€“75% of FVC (FEF25â€“75)), which were further transformed to age-, height- and sex-adjusted standard deviation units [17].",1
"The tests adhered to American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria for standardisation and reproducibility of flowâ€“volume measurement [18], with the exception of ATS recommendations for duration of expiration [19]; as many children did not fulfil forced expiratory time >6\u2005s end-of-test criteria, a minimal volume change over the final 1\u2005s was used.",1
"These included maternal age at delivery, sex of child, multiple pregnancy, season of birth, maternal history of atopic diseases (hay fever, asthma, eczema, allergies, or attacks of wheezing with whistling on the chest or attacks of breathlessness in the past 2\u2005years), parity, highest educational qualification, housing tenure, financial difficulties, ethnicity, breastfeeding duration and maternal factors during pregnancy (smoking status, anxiety score (Crownâ€“Crisp Experiential Index), paracetamol use, antibiotic use, infections (urinary infection, influenza, rubella, thrush, genital herpes, other), supplement use and total energy intake (kJÂ·dayâˆ’1)).",1
"Smoking status was categorised as the maximum exposure during pregnancy (never, passive smoking only, 1â€“9, 10â€“19 and â‰¥20 cigarettes per day).",1
Statistical analyses\nWe compared the distributions of child and maternal variables across maternal free sugar intake quintiles using F-statistics for differences in continuous variables and Chi-squared tests for differences in categorical variables.,1
"Logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression and linear regression were used to analyse relations between maternal free sugar intake in pregnancy and binary, categorical and continuous outcomes, respectively.",1
"After log-transforming total IgE, linear regression was used to estimate geometric mean ratios for IgE; confidence limits were calculated using Huber variances.",1
We analysed free sugar intake in quintiles: 1) as a categorical variable using the lowest quintile as reference to allow for a nonlinear pattern of association and 2) as a continuous variable to test for linear trend ( i.e.,1
per quintile effect).,1
"For all regression analyses, two stages of adjustment were used.",1
"prematurity [21,22], impaired fetal growth [21,23], maternal obesity and weight gain [24â€“26], and offspring obesity [27,28].",1
"As sensitivity analyses, we repeated analyses after exclusion of mothers with implausible energy intakes (<2500 or >25\u200a000\u2005kJÂ·dayâˆ’1[34]) and after exclusion of mothers with diabetes (whose offspring will have experienced high fetal exposure to glucose).",1
"All statistical analyses were carried out using Stata version 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).",1
"Results\nOf the 13\u200a972 singleton or twin children alive at 1\u2005year of age, information on maternal diet was available for 12\u200a078, of whom there was information on at least one of the outcomes of interest for 8956 (supplementary figure E2).",1
"Among children with available information, 12.2% had current doctor-diagnosed asthma, 10.7% had current wheezing with whistling, 8.8% had current hay fever, 16.2% had current eczema, 21.5% had atopy and 61.8% did not have any of these five outcomes.",1

Vitamin D is primarily synthesized in the skin and is partly derived from dietary sources[4].,1

The only exclusion criterion was pregnancy exceeding 16 gestational weeks at inclusion.,1
"Gestational age at delivery and data collection was determined by routine ultrasound in the second trimester, but gestational age at inclusion was based on the date of the last menstrual period.",1
"Women who terminated the pregnancy ( N \u2009=\u200931), were lost to follow-up ( N \u2009=\u200913) or carried more than one foetus ( N \u2009=\u200926) were excluded from the present analyses.",1
Pregnancy termination was mostly due to fetal malformations.,1
Women who were lost to follow-up had moved and their medical records could not be retrieved.,1
"This study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and all procedures were approved by the Regional Ethics Committee in Gothenburg, Sweden.",1
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.,1
Outcomes\nSGA was defined as either weight or length at birth below 2 SD of the gender-specific population mean [14].,1
"LBW was defined as weight at birth <\u20092500\xa0g. Preterm delivery was defined as delivery before gestational week+days 37\u2009+\u20090, including both induced and spontaneous preterm delivery.",1
Pregnancy loss was defined as both spontaneous abortions from gestational week 4 and intrauterine fetal death (IUFD).,1
"Late pregnancy loss was defined as spontaneous abortion at gestational week â‰¥\u200914\u2009+\u20090, including IUFD.",1
IUFD was defined as pregnancy loss at gestational week â‰¥\u200922\u2009+\u20090.,1
Information on IUFD was collected from medical records from the obstetrics care.,1
"Exposure\nMaternal blood samples were collected from each participant at two time points; before gestational week 16 (predominantly week 8â€“12, first trimester, T1) and after gestational week 31 (predominantly week 32â€“35, third trimester, T3).",1
Non-fasting venous blood samples were drawn in gel serum separating tubes and centrifuged for 10\xa0min within 2 h of sampling.,1
Serum was stored at âˆ’\u200970\xa0Â°C until analysis of 25OHD.,1
"Analyses were performed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS, Mass spectrometer API 4000) by the clinical chemistry laboratory in Region SkÃ¥ne, Sweden, certified by the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme [15].",1
The LC-MS/MS method has a measuring range of 6â€“450\xa0nmol/L for 25OHD3and of 6â€“225\xa0nmol/L for 25OHD2.,1
The inter-assay coefficient of variation is 6% at 40\xa0nmol/L for both 25OHD3and 25OHD2.,1
Sampling and laboratory analyses have been described previously [3].,1
Maternal serum T1 and T3 samples were analysed in sequence.,1
"At T1 and T3, participants answered questionnaires regarding lifestyle factors and background data.",1
Neonatal and gestational data were obtained from antenatal and obstetrics medical records.,1
Information on BMI at T1 and season of conception (Decemberâ€“May or Juneâ€“November) was obtained from the medical records.,1
"Data on education level (â‰¤primary level, secondary level or university level) and origin (continent of birth: Northern Europe, Continental Europe, America, Asia, Africa) were collected from study questionnaires.",1
"Statistical analysis\nConcentrations of 25OHD at T1 and T3 were used as categorical variables, grouped into 25OHD <\u200930 (used as reference category), 30â€“49.9, 50â€“74.9, 75â€“99.9 and â‰¥\u2009100\xa0nmol/L.",1
Quartiles were not used because the distribution of 25OHD was different at T1 and T3.,1
T1 25OHD was also investigated as a continuous variable as there were few cases in some categories.,1
"Change in 25OHD was calculated as the difference between T3 and T1 (T3-T1) and was coded into 3 groups: decrease in 25OHD (â‰¤\u20090\xa0nmol/L), small increase (0.1â€“29.99\xa0nmol/L) or large increase (â‰¥30\xa0nmol/L).",1
"Multivariable logistic regression analyses of the outcome variables SGA, LBW and preterm delivery were performed with 25OHD at T1, T3 and change in 25OHD during pregnancy as the independent variables.",1
"For SGA, appropriate for gestational age and large for gestational age were combined as reference.",1
Potential confounders for the associations studied were identified using directed acyclic graphs (www.dagitty.net) [17].,1
"Variables BMI, season of conception, education level and origin were identified and included in the final models.",1
"In the multivariable analysis with change in 25OHD as the independent variable, T1 25OHD was also included as a confounder.",1
Multivariable logistic regression analysis of the outcome pregnancy loss was also performed with 25OHD at T1 (continuous and categorical) as independent variable.,1
Unadjusted logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between T1 25OHD (<\u200930\xa0nmol/L; no/yes) and IUFD.,1
Significance was accepted at p \u2009<\u20090.05.,1
Computer software IBM SPSS Statistics version 22.0 was used for all statistical analyses.,1
"Results\nIn total, 2052 women were included in this study, 2046 with a blood sample at T1 and 1816 at T3 (Fig.1).",1
"In total, 1810 women had samples collected both in T1 and T3.",1
Characteristics of the women and the live born infants are shown in Table\xa01.,1
Mean infant birth weight was 3542 (538) grams and mean gestational age at delivery was 280 (12.4) days.,1
Mean (SD) maternal 25OHD at T1 was 64 (24.4) nmol/L and 75 (34.4) nmol/L at T3.,1
"At T1, 10% had 25OHD concentrations <\u200930\xa0nmol/L and 9% at T3 (Table\xa02).",1

PubMed Central:,1
Methods\nThe current prospective observational study is based on the data collected from 812 pregnant women.,1
Dietary data was collected using a validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire.,1
Results\nThree identified major dietary patterns according to the results obtained from the factor loading matrix were (i) â€œwestern dietary patternâ€; (ii) â€œtraditional dietary patternâ€; (iii) â€œhealthy dietary patternâ€.,1
"However, such associations were not seen in women taking healthy and traditional dietary patterns.",1
1,1
"Introduction\nAnthropometric measurements, including body weight, head circumference, and height of newborn infants, are widely assessed as determinants of impaired fetal growth, intrauterine environment, and maternal nutrition [1].",1
Low birth weight infants are susceptible to higher risk of developing iron deficiency anemia leading to impaired development and altered longer term neurodevelopment [3].,1
2,1
Methods\n\n2.1.,1
"Study Design and Participants\nThe current prospective observational study was conducted among pregnant women during the first trimester, who were being attended at health centers across Isfahan city in the central part of Iran during 2015-2016.",1
A random sample of 812 pregnant women was selected from 20 various health centers by the multistage cluster random sampling method.,1
"Eligible criteria included singleton pregnant women during the first trimester without any medical condition, use of medications, and without following a specific diet.",1
Exclusion criteria were avoiding of follow-up during the study and current-smoker women.,1
Also we exclude twin pregnancies.,1
Informed consent was obtained from all participants.,1
This study was approved by the research council (research project number: 193053) and ethics committee (research ethics number: IR.MUI.REC193053).,1
2.2.,1
Data Collection\n\n2.2.1.,1
"Assessment of Dietary Intake\nPregnant women in these analyses completed validated 117-item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in the first visit, at 8â€“16 weeks.",1
The validity and reliability of FFQ had been previously evaluated [20].,1
"We inquired about the consumption of each food item, based on commonly used units or portion sizes, over the preceding 12 months on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.",1
Participants were asked to report their dietary intakes of foods based on nine multiple choice frequency response categories varying from â€œnever or less than once a monthâ€ to â€œ12 or more times per dayâ€.,1
Portion sizes of consumed foods were converted to grams from household measures.,1
Supplements were also included to assess total nutrient intake.,1
"Then nutrient and energy intakes were computed by using NUTRITIONIST IV software (version 7.0; N-Squared Computing, Salem, OR), which was designed for Iranian foods.",1
All nutrient values were energy-adjusted using the residuals method.,1
2.2.2.,1
Food items similar in nutrient profile were combined into 33 predefined food groups (Table 1).,1
"When the item was unique in the nutrient profile, it was not combined (e.g., salt).",1
The factors were rotated by varimax rotation function.,1
Correlated variables are aggregated by factor analysis.,1
"The obtained factors are linear combinations of the included variables, explaining as much variation in the original variables as possible.",1
"Three factors were retained, based on the screen plot, an eigenvalue of more than 1.9, and the interpretability of the derived factors and of the earlier literature.",1
The individual scores for the 3 patterns show the values estimated for each individual based on their consumption of foods and the factor loadings of the foods.,1
2.2.3.,1
"Assessment of Other Variables\nFor the infants, birth date, gestational age, and anthropometric measurements including body weight, head circumference, and height were recorded at birth.",1
"Neonatal anthropometric measurements were categorized according to WHO standards and as follows: low birth weight (LBW); a birth weight less than 2500 g, normal birth weight; a birth weight more than 2500 g and less than 3900, low height; a height less than 47 cm, normal height; a height more than 47 cm and less than 55 cm, low head circumference; a head circumference less than 33 cm, normal head circumference; a head circumference more than 33 cm and less than 37 cm [21].",1
"We also obtained anthropometric data (height and weight), demographic data (occupation and education), and clinical data (delivery status, IUGR and history of preterm birth, abortion, delivery status, and stillbirth) of the pregnant women.",1
"[""To assess participants' information regarding age and gender, marital status, and educational level, we used a standard self-reported questionnaire.""]",1
"[""Subjects' weight was measured using a balanced digital scale to the nearest 100 g, in light clothing and barefoot.""]",1
Height was measured with a tape measure while the subjects were in a standing position.,1
"BMI, defined as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, was calculated.",1
General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPPAQ) was used to assess the physical activity of participants [22].,1
"According to GPPAQ, participants were categorized into 4 levels of physical activity based on hours/week.",1
2.3.,1
"Statistical Analysis\nAs was mentioned, principal component analysis was used to identify major dietary patterns based on the 33 food groups.",1
Three factors were considered major dietary patterns.,1
Factor scores of dietary patterns were calculated by summing intakes of foods weighed by their factor loading for each participant.,1
Participants were categorized by quintiles of dietary pattern scores.,1
Continuous variables were evaluated across quintile categories of dietary pattern scores by one-way analysis of variance.,1
Chi-square test was used to examine significant differences in the distribution of study participants in terms of categorical variables across different quintile categories of dietary pattern scores.,1
"Further adjustments were made for physical activity and social-economic levels in model 2, and additionally adjustment for delivery status, IUGR, preterm delivery, history of abortion, and stillbirth were made in model 3.",1
"All statistical tests were two-sided, and P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.",1
"SPSS 16.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.",1
3,1
Results\n\n3.1.,1
"Identified Major Dietary Patterns\nThree major dietary patterns were identified according to the results obtained from the factor loading matrix (Table 2): (i) â€œwestern dietary patternâ€ which was greatly loaded by processed meats, fruit, fruit juice, citrus, nuts, fish, desserts and sweets, sugar, saturated fat, sweat fruit, potato, legumes, coffee, egg, pizza, high fat dairy, whole grain, and soft drink; (ii) â€œtraditional dietary patternâ€ which was high in refined grains, colored vegetables, olive, sugar, salt, spices, unsaturated fat, garlic, onion, and tea; (iii) â€œhealthy dietary patternâ€ which was high in green vegetables, leafy vegetable, colored vegetables, fruit, low-fat dairy, poultry, bulky vegetables, red meat, citrus, nuts, fish, evil, marinades, sweat fruit, egg, and unsaturated fat.",1
3.2.,1
"General Characteristics and Dietary Intakes of Study Participants\nAccording to inclusion and exclusion criteria, 812 subjects with mean (SD) maternal age of 29.4 (4.85) remained for the current analysis.",1
"Energy and nutrients intake of the study participants across different categories of healthy, western, and traditional dietary patterns were reported in Tables3,4, and5, respectively.",1
"In all dietary patterns, the most of energy and nutrients intake were different in all levels of dietary patterns adherence.",1
The overall characteristics of the study population across different categories of dietary patterns are presented inTable 6.,1
"In addition, regarding the distribution of the women across categories of western dietary pattern, it was found that those with the highest adherence had significantly higher social-economic level, employed husband, history of cesarean, and less IUGR and stillbirth history.",1
"[""Furthermore, women with highest quartile of traditional dietary pattern had significantly higher social-economic level, education, and husband's education compared with those in the lowest quartile.""]",1
"Data inTable 7represent the crude and adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for ORs from the multivariate analysis, where neonatal anthropometric measurements are the dependent variables and major maternal dietary patterns the independent variables.",1
"In all fitted models, the low level of each dietary pattern (quartile 1) was defined as the reference category.",1
The comparison of neonatal height in different categories of maternal dietary patterns showed maternal dietary patterns were not related to neonatal height in all crude and adjusted models.,1
"Also, there were positive nonsignificant relationships between adherence to western [OR 1.31, 95% (CI) (0.68-2.51), P = 0.28] and healthy [OR 1.02, 95% (CI) (0.39-2.63), P= 0.40] dietary pattern of mothers with having short height infant in the final adjusted model.",1
"Finding about neonatal weight showed that those in the top quartile of adherence to western dietary pattern had marginally significant chance of having low weight infant compared with those in the bottom quartile in the crude model [OR 1.84, 95% (CI) (0.94-3.60), P = 0.05].",1
"The same results were obtained after adjusting for potential confounding variables in model 1 [OR 2.05, 95% (CI) (1.01-4.15), P = 0.05] and model 2 [OR 2.04, 95% (CI) (0.97-4.32), P = 0.06].",1
"In addition, lower marginal significant chance of having low weight infant was found among women who were in the top adherence of traditional dietary pattern [OR 0.76, 95% (CI) (0.32-1.77), P = 0.05] in the crude model.",1
"However, maternal adherence to healthy dietary pattern was not related to birth weight of infants in all crude and adjusted models.",1
We found no significant association either between maternal western dietary pattern and head circumference of infant or between healthy or traditional dietary pattern and mentioned measure.,1
"In final adjusted model, women with a higher adherence to western dietary pattern had 4.88 times larger odds for having an infant with low birth head circumference than those with a lower adherence level (OR: 4.88; 95% CI: 0.79-30.19 P = 0.35).",1
"Same result was obtained about healthy dietary pattern [OR 3.70, 95% (CI) (0.72-17.86), P = 0.52].",1
"Furthermore, lower risk of low birth head circumference was nonsignificantly associated with a traditional dietary pattern [OR 0.58, 95% (CI) (0.13-2.51), P = 0.41].",1
4,1
"As was mentioned, we did not see any associations of healthy and traditional dietary patterns with consumption of red meats in the healthy dietary pattern and refined grain, salt, and sugar in the traditional dietary pattern.",1
"Iranian usual diet also contains high amounts of salt, which means that salt intake among them is almost twofold the recommended levels.",1
"In addition, fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy intake among them is low; however, legumes intake is good in the mentioned population [28].",1
The majority of pregnant women are encouraged to healthier dietary changes.,1
"However, the main strengths of the current study include its multidisciplinary scope including epidemiology, statistics, pediatrics, maternity, and nutrition.",1

"Marginal sex-specific differences occurred between vitamin D status and GDM: women carrying a female fetus had a 56% decreased risk for GDM in those with low-moderate levels of standardised vitamin D (44â€“63\xa0nmol/L) compared to moderate-high levels (aRR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.97), whilst in women carrying a male fetus, a 55% decreased risk of GDM was found with high standardised vitamin D when compared to moderately-high vitamin D, but this was not statistically significant (aRR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.15, 1.38).",1
"Electronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s12884-018-1887-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",1
Vitamin D status is determined by measuring circulating serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D2\u2009+\u20093(25(OH)D).,1
"Studies focused on high-risk populations, for example, veiled, dark-skinned or obese women in Australia and New Zealand, report between 50 and 94% of women to be vitamin D deficient [8â€“10].",1
"Methods\n\nStudy population\nThis study utilised data collected from the multi-centre, prospective cohort Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints (SCOPE) study [28].",1
Nulliparous women carrying a singleton pregnancy were recruited between November 2004 and September 2008 in Adelaide (Australia) and Auckland (New Zealand).,1
"Ethics approval was obtained from Central Northern Adelaide Health Service Ethics of Human Research Committee on 2 September 2005 (ethics number REC 1714/5/2008) and Northern Region Ethics Committee, in Auckland on 23 April 2003 (ethics number AKX/02/00/364).",1
All participants provided written informed consent.,1
"At 15\u2009Â±\u20091\xa0weeksâ€™ gestation, women were interviewed by a research midwife and asked questions on maternal demographics and lifestyle and had physical measurements taken, including height and weight.",1
"Records included ethnicity, age, body mass index (BMI), socioeconomic index (SEI) and multivitamin use [29].",1
BMI was calculated as weight (kg)/height2(m2).,1
"Obesity was defined as BMI â‰¥30\xa0kg/m2, overweight as BMI â‰¥25 and\u2009<\u200930\xa0kg/m2, normal weight as BMI >\u200920 and\u2009<\u200925\xa0kg/m2and underweight as BMI â‰¤20\xa0kg/m2.",1
"SEI was calculated using the New Zealand SEI of occupational status, deriving a number between 10 and 90 based on the womanâ€™s occupation; a higher number indicates higher socioeconomic status [30].",1
This population of women was predominantly Caucasian and thus maternal ethnicity was categorised into 2 main groups; Caucasian and non-Caucasian.,1
Uncomplicated pregnancies were defined as those without any pregnancy disorder who delivered an appropriate weight for gestational age infant at term (â‰¥37\xa0weeks gestation) [31].,1
"Pregnancy complications studied included PE, gestational hypertension (GH), GDM, sPTB and SGA and have been previously defined [28,29,31,32].",1
Measurement of serum 25(OH)D\nNon-fasting whole peripheral blood samples were collected into non-heparinised tubes at 15Â±1 weeksâ€™ gestation.,1
Serum was processed within 4\xa0h of collection and stored at âˆ’\u200980\xa0Â°C until required.,1
"Average intra- and inter-assay coefficient of variation (CV) were 5.4 and 8.8%, respectively.",1
Both serum 25(OH)D3and 25(OH)D2were measured independently and combined to provide a total 25(OH)D in nmol/L [27].,1
Statistical analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed in R (v3.1.1) [33].,1
Data were checked for normality using a Shapiro-Wilks test and differences between women recruited in Adelaide compared to Auckland were tabulated and compared using a Welchâ€™s t-test (continuous variables) or Fisherâ€™s exact test (categorical variables).,1
"Briefly, vitamin D concentrations were standardized by taking the difference of 25(OH)D concentration to the average 25(OH)D concentration of the corresponding month.",1
This 25(OH)D concentration was then added to the overall population mean 25(OH)D concentration: 68.09\xa0nmol/L.,1
"Quartiles, based on the distribution amongst the population of women studied, in the standardised concentrations were then used to create cut-points and designated â€˜lowâ€™ (<\u200944\xa0nmol/L), â€˜low-moderateâ€™ (44â€“63\xa0nmol/L), â€˜moderate-highâ€™ (63â€“81\xa0nmol/L) and â€˜highâ€™ (>\u200981\xa0nmol/L) categories of serum 25(OH)D.\nGeneralised linear models (Poisson with log link and robust variance estimates) were used to calculate the risk ratios for pregnancy complications by standardised serum 25(OH)D concentrations calculated among the women who had an uncomplicated pregnancy.",1
Potential confounders for vitamin D status were assessed using linear modelling.,1
"These analyses were also repeated but using the current definitions of vitamin D deficiency: <\u200925, 25â€“50, 50â€“75 and\u2009>\u200975\xa0nmol/L in the non-standardised data [7].",1
"Results\n\nPopulation characteristics\nOf 3229 women recruited as part of SCOPE at the Adelaide and Auckland centres, serum samples at 15\u2009Â±\u20091\xa0weeksâ€™ gestation to measure 25(OH)D were available for 2800 (87%) women of whom, 1156 (41%) were recruited in Adelaide and 1644 (59%) were recruited in Auckland.",1
Maternal characteristics are shown in Table\xa01.,1
"Mean\u2009Â±\u2009SD SEI of the Auckland women was also higher compared to that in women recruited in Adelaide (Auckland: 48.0\u2009Â±\u200914.8 vs. Adelaide: 27.7\u2009Â±\u200910.5, P \u2009<\u20090.001).",1
Average hours of sunlight per day in Adelaide from September 2005 to September 2008 were obtained from the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology and compared against serum vitamin D measured in the women recruited in Adelaide (Fig.,1
1a; black line/left axis serum 25(OH)D and grey line/right axis average hours of sunlight).,1
The means for serum 25(OH)D by month of sampling were also separated for women recruited in Adelaide and women recruited in Auckland (Fig.1b).,1

The association between â€œstandardisedâ€ 25(OH)D with pregnancy complications is presented in Table\xa02.,1
"Using moderate-high as a reference (standardised vitamin D 63â€“81\xa0nmol/L), there was no appreciable effect of having a low, low-moderate or high vitamin D with the risk of developing any pregnancy complication after adjusting for confounders.",1
"When women were categorised based on clinical definitions of vitamin D deficiency and serum 25(OH)D between 50 and 75\xa0nmol/L used as the reference, no significant relationship between vitamin D status and adverse pregnancy outcome was found (Table2).",1
Similar results were observed when vitamin D status was based on clinical definitions of deficiency (Additional file1: Table S1).,1
"The placenta expresses all the necessary components to convert 25(OH)D to the active form and thus utilise active vitamin D either locally or in a paracrine manner [45,47].",1
"However, routine vitamin D supplementation did not occur during the time period the women in the current study were recruited.",1
"For example, active vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) is the principal hormone that regulates calcium absorption within the intestine [53] and is integral to maintaining calcium homeostasis.",1

A flow chart of the study is presented inFigure 1.,1
"First, pregnant women were briefed on the study objectives and the confidentiality of maternal and neonatal information, and they then signed informed consents.",1
"Then, 41 eligible pregnant women in their first trimester were selected through convenience sampling.",1
"The study inclusion criteria were age 18-40 years, singleton pregnancy, no systemic diseases such as lupus and diabetes mellitus, and Iranian nationality.",1
"The study exclusion criteria were pregnancy complications (e.g., diabetes, preeclampsia), psychological problems, tobacco or alcohol use in the first trimester of pregnancy, medications other than pregnancy supplements, abnormal stresses such as family bereavement and accidents, migration, living outside of the study area, failure to cooperate, follow-up exitus, and becoming pregnant again within a year.",1
"Demographic details, pregnancy history and maternal medical history were found through direct interviews with mothers in their first pregnancy visit, based on the ministry of healthâ€™s routine prenatal care questionnaire.",1
"Gestational age was calculated based on the first day of the last menstruation (LMP), or the first trimester ultrasound (if uncertain about LMP).",1
"Weight, blood pressure, and heart rate of the fetus were measured by the same person using a digital scale, digital barometer, and fetal heart detector (sonicaid).",1
"At the end of their visit, mothers received training on proper pregnancy nutrition.",1
The researcher took non-fasting venous blood samples from mothers during 6-12 and 15-20 gestational weeks between 09:00 and 11:00 am.,1
"The samples were added to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-containing tubes and sent to endocrinology and metabolism laboratories of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran within 24 hours and kept at 2-8 Â°C.",1
"For plasma separation, samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm and 4 Â°C for 10 minutes.",1
The resulting plasma was frozen at a temperature of â‰¤-20 Â°C until required for analysis.,1
"Anthropometric indicators (birth height, weight, and head circumference) were measured.",1
"The next follow-up of infants was performed between six months and one year after childbirth (both cesarean and vaginal) through telephone contact with the mothers, during which they were asked to attend their local health centers for the assessment of anthropometric indicators (growth monitoring curve, height, weight, and head circumference) and also neonatal diseases.",1
Children were assessed based on the ministry of healthâ€™s questionnaire for children under 8 years of age.,1
"Afterwards, participating mothers were matched and divided into groups A and B based on pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) as follows: normal (18.5-25 kg/m2) (n=16) and overweight and obese (â‰¥25 kg/m2) (n=25).",1
Pre-pregnancy BMI based on pre-pregnancy weight was calculated using the following equation as defined by the World Health Organization: weight/height2.,1
"BMI between 18.5 and 25 kg/m2is considered normal, and â‰¥25 kg/m2is abnormal.",1
"Statistical Analysis\nThe homogeneity of the two groups was confirmed through statistical tests in terms of underlying and demographic variables such as age, education, employment, household size, and neonatal sex, fertility status, income, childbirth method, and family planning, the time presenting for postpartum childcare, feeding method (formula, breast milk, or both), hypothyroidism, neonatal anemia, and referral to physician.",1
"Serum visfatin levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with human visfatin (ZellBio GmbH, Germany; Ulm kit, Cat No: ZB-3408-H9648).",1
"Finally, visfatin levels were compared using data from maternal and neonatal anthropometric measurements.",1
Normal distribution of variables in each group was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.,1
"The independent and paired t-test were used for normally distributed quantitative variables, the chi-square test was used for qualitative variables, and the Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests were used for non-normally distributed variables.",1
"The relationships among the present study variables in each group were separately assessed using independent t, Pearsonâ€™s, linear regression, and Spearmanâ€™s ordinal correlation tests.",1
"Finally, lambda stat was used to compare correlation coefficients of variables in the two groups at p<0.05.",1
Results\nDemographic and underlying variables from the two groups are presented inTable 1.,1
"Variations in visfatin level during pregnancy\nMean non-fasting serum visfatin level of participating mothers (n=41) was 59.4Â±68.01 ng/mL (range, 4.9-234 ng/mL) in the first trimester, and 76.98Â±75.55 ng/mL (range, 4.6-248 ng/mL) in the second trimester, and variations in visfatin level were reported as 17.58Â±26.46 ng/mL.",1

"A BRAC PO area approximately comprises of 40 to 50 villages with an average population of 13,000 people.",1
We will have a total number of 112 BRAC PO for randomisation.,1
We will randomly select 100 clusters with an equal number of clusters in each arm.,1
The research team took written approval for the study from Directorate General of Health Service (DGHS) under Ministry of Health & Family Welfare before allocating the clusters to a treatment group or the trial interventions begin.,1
Eligibility criteria for inclusion of cluster\nWe will exclude any potential BRAC PO area (cluster) if there are any other maternal and or neonatal interventions either by the government or non-government organisations in the area.,1
We will identify any such program by contacting local officials in the sub-districts in the Dhaka Division.,1
"All women aged between 15 to 49\xa0years, who are pregnant and their gestational age is â‰¤90\xa0days, and are permanent residents of the Shonjibon study area will be eligible for the study.",1
"Formative research\nBefore the intervention started, we conducted a formative study using qualitative methods.",1
"We collected the data from July to October 2012, in two villages, one in Mymensingh and one in Netrokona â€“ two of the five districts included in the Shonjibon Trial.",1
"The field team consisted of three women and two men trained in anthropology or social sciences, who had experience in collecting qualitative data.",1
"Four qualitative methods â€“ in-depth interviews (35 pregnant women, 20 older women and 11 husbands), key informant interviews (20 with CHWs, program managers, informal care providers, gynaecologists and traditional birth attendants), focus group discussions (2 with Shasthya Shebika and 1 with female college students) and observations of the lowest level of health facility (community clinics) (2) were conducted.",1
We explore womenâ€™s and family membersâ€™ perceptions of: cultural norms during pregnancy; birth weight; IFA supplementation; and experience using IFA supplements during pregnancy.,1
"We conducted the key informant interviews to understand the community norms around IFA supplementation, and challenges and successes of the existing programme.",1
We used FGDs to understand both perceptions regarding the need for IFA tablets during pregnancy and the state of IFA supplementation programmes.,1
"In two community clinics, we conducted an hour-long observation to understand the implementation of the national IFA programme.",1
"Intervention\nFrom the formative study, we identified culturally appropriate and feasible ways of implementing the intervention [14].",1
"We conducted a pilot study in four BRAC village fieldworker areas, two with intervention and two comparison areas, to test the feasibility of our intervention.",1
"Early identification of pregnancy\nIn the intervention clusters, trained SS will identify pregnant women through systematic door-to-door visits of the households in her catchment area and follow-up with all women of reproductive age about their recent history of missed menstrual periods.",1
We will financially incentivise the SS for early identification of pregnant women.,1
"Regular supply of IFA supplements and counselling\nUpon receiving the consent icddr,b study staff (Field Implementers or FI) will hand over the first two months of supply of iron-folic acid capsules, each containing 60\xa0mg of elemental iron and 400Î¼g of folic acid.",1
She will also counsel the mother about the benefits of IFA supplements in pregnancy.,1
"The SS will then make regular fortnightly visits to the woman until delivery to ensure resupply of supplements, and provide counselling in support of early uptake, continued use, and compliance with the supplementation regime until delivery.",1
This intervention is consistent with the Bangladesh Ministry of Health guidelines.,1
"Improve adherence and monitor compliance\nTo improve adherence, a local pharmaceutical company (Eskayef Bangladesh Limited) will produce IFA supplements in an attractive capsule shell and special blister package.",1
Each strip will consist of 15 capsules.,1
"At the time of enrolment, we will assign each mother a box consisting of 8\xa0months of supply of iron-folic acid supplements.",1
We will attach the details of the pregnant women to the box during registration in the trial.,1
"At the time of resupply, the SS will collect the empty strips from the previous round.",1
"If she finds any unused capsules, she will inquire about the missing doses and further counsel the women about the importance of regular consumption of IFA supplements.",1
We will provide a specially designed medicine box to each participant to preserve the medicine.,1
It will also serve as a reminder for regular consumption and safely store the medicines away from child access.,1
"In addition to this, a special call centre will be set up centrally where trained nutrition counsellors will systematically make bi-weekly calls to monitor compliance with the supplementation regime.",1
Concomitant treatment\nThe research team will advise all Shonjibon study participants in the intervention arm not to consume any additional iron or folic acid supplements from other sources during her pregnancy.,1
"Management and training\nOverall around 3920 SS and 100 FI will deliver the intervention, under the supervision of central field supervisory team.",1
There will be one FI for each cluster.,1
"The central team will comprise of three research fellows, one medical officer and one research investigator and one BRAC national manager.",1
The field supervision team will comprise of five Field Research Officers and five District Managers.,1
"We will train the BRAC village workers and volunteers in sub-district health centres to detect and monitor pregnancies, to maintain pregnancy records, to manage supply and distribution of supplements, communication and counselling skills for behaviour change related to use of iron-folic acid supplements.",1
The central team will train the field team and monitor the process of delivery of the intervention.,1
"The BRAC PO will provide technical support to the SK and SS, and will help them resolve any problems through regular meetings in the field.",1
Control\nWe used usual iron supplementation program as the comparator.,1
We will identify and confirm pregnant women in the control clusters using methods similar to those described for the intervention arm.,1
Women will not receive any additional information or counselling other than usual standard care provided by the existing BRAC structure.,1
Both intervention and control treatment arms will receive the usual antenatal and postnatal care services by BRAC.,1
Trial outcomes\nThe primary trial outcome will be the difference in the neonatal mortality rate between the intervention and control areas.,1
"The secondary trial outcomes will include: (1) percentage of women using IFA supplements in the first trimester of pregnancy; (2) percentage of live births with low birth weight and with preterm delivery; (3) percentage of neonatal deaths attributable to preterm delivery, and to birth asphyxia; (4) mean marginal additional expenditure associated with early IFA supplements, and the mean cost per neonatal death prevented; (5) the percentage of pregnant women reporting side effects including nausea and vomiting.",1
"Outcome measurements\n\nNeonatal deaths\nWe will investigate all neonatal deaths reported by the SS to the Field Implementers or by maternal recall at the final follow-up visit at 42\xa0days postpartum, using standard questionnaires collected by trained staff.",1
We will use this data to calculate estimates of neonatal mortality in both arms from baseline to the end of the intervention period.,1
Verbal autopsy\nTrained Field Research Officers will interview caretakers of infants who die in the neonatal period using the World Health Organization (WHO) Standard Verbal Autopsy Questionnaire [15] within one month of the death.,1
Investigators will extract and code the symptoms from both the closed-ended questions and open narratives.,1
We will use physician-certified verbal autopsy method to identify cases of death related to preterm delivery and birth asphyxia using the hierarchical assignment of causes of death.,1
"At least two physicians will independently review the data, and they will base their decision on an agreement.",1
Review by a third physician will resolve any discrepancy between the two diagnoses.,1
Birth weight\nWe will measure birth weight within 24\xa0h of delivery using standard methods with a portable electronic scale.,1
"The SS will notify the Field Implementers of any births in their area, and both will visit the mother and her infant within 24\xa0h, although measurements will be accepted up to 72\xa0h after birth.",1
Duration of gestation\nWe will measure the duration of gestation will be measured using the date of last menstrual period with the pregnancy confirmed by urine test in the field.,1
"Other measurements\nSocial, economic and demographic characteristics will be collected in a questionnaire collected at enrolment and will use standard demographic and health survey methods of an inventory of household assets to construct a wealth index, [16] as well as the socio-demographic characteristics of the mother.",1
Cost-effectiveness analysis\nThe economic evaluation will take a societal perspective.,1
We will base the data for the cost-effectiveness analysis on the costs and outcomes observed in the trial.,1
"The costs of the intervention will include cost and distribution of the supplements, training of SS workers, organisational costs associated with the administration of the programme and the cost of incentives.",1
"We will ask the participants to record use of health services at each follow-up interview, which will enable assessment of potential cost offsets particularly associated with differences in rates of birth complications and neonatal morbidity.",1
We will estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios as incremental cost per neonate death avoided; per low birth weight infant avoided and per life-year saved.,1
Years of life saved will be based on any difference in survival of mothers and infants observed during the trial and estimated using current life expectancy in Bangladesh.,1
"Standard methods for estimating uncertainty and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve will be generated to provide information on the probability that the intervention is cost-effective, at different willingness to pay thresholds.",1
"Groundwater iron\nWe will measure the level of groundwater iron in all the households of our study using a validated test kit tool [Â±0.1\xa0mg/L, FerroVer method, HACH Iron Test kit, Model IR-18B].",1
"Sampling frame and sample size\nTo detect a 25% reduction in neonatal mortality (33 neonatal deaths/1000 live births in control to 24.8 neonatal deaths/1000 live births in the intervention group), with 90% power, 5% two-sided alpha, 1:1 ratio of treatment allocation and intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.0245, we require 100 clusters (each covering an average of 4000 households), or 50 clusters per treatment group, with a total of 30,000 live births over one year.",1
This sample would allow detection of a 22% relative difference between treatment groups with 80% power.,1
"To detect a 30% reduction in preterm delivery from 15% in control compared to 10.5% in the intervention arm, assuming 80% power, 5% level of significance, intracluster correlation of 0.012 for small birth size (Bangladesh DHS data), would require a sample size of 1300/arm or 40 pregnant women from 64 clusters.",1
A smaller sample size of 570 women/arm or 40 pregnant women from 28 clusters is needed to detect a 30% reduction in LBW with the same assumptions.,1
"Our cluster is one BRAC PO area that consists of ~\u200913,000 people.",1
"Recruitment and consent of women\nIn the intervention clusters, SSs will make systematic door-to-door visits to identify new pregnancies through menstrual cycle tracking of all women of reproductive age.",1
"Once the woman reports a missed period, the SS will immediately notify the Field Implementers by mobile phone.",1
The Field Implementers will then visit the pregnant mother along with the SS within the next 48\xa0h to conduct a pregnancy test and enquire about the last menstrual period.,1
"If the pregnancy test is positive and the pregnancy is within the first trimester, the Field Implementers will register the mother and seek written consent.",1
"We will obtain written, witnessed informed consent from all participants.",1
"Assignment of treatments\nAn investigator remote from the field area will assign the interventions to eligible clusters using a fixed randomisation scheme with a uniform allocation ratio of treatments, stratified by subdistrict or Upazila.",1
The random allocation sequence will be generated using Stata 12 software (StataCorp.,1
2011,1
Stata Statistical Software: Release 12.,1
"College Station, TX: StataCorp LP).",1
The nature of the intervention precludes the masking of the treatments.,1
Evaluation\n\nData collection team\nA separate team of trained data collectors not involved in the implementation of the intervention will collect data for evaluation.,1
"The evaluation team will consist of 135 data collectors, five field supervisors and five field research officers.",1
Each data collector will be responsible for one cluster.,1
"We will train the evaluation team over a four-week period, and standardize measurement methods and retrain as needed every six months.",1
Data collection schedule\nThe data collectors will visit each woman a total number of six times from the time of enrolment till 42\xa0days after delivery.,1
"These visits will be made between 12 and 14\xa0weeks, 20â€“24\xa0weeks, 28â€“32\xa0weeks, within 24\xa0h of delivery, 7â€“10\xa0days after delivery, 38â€“42\xa0days after delivery (Fig.",1
2).,1
Caption (FIG): FIG.,1
"2\n\nTrial flow chart and intervention schedule\n\nTypes of information collected\nOver the pregnancy and neonatal period, data collectors will collect information regarding household characteristics, reproductive history, pregnancy information, medication history, details about consumption of IFA supplements, current health status, any side effects from the supplements, antenatal care, birth outcome, birth weight, immediate newborn care and neonatal deaths.",1
We will also collect information on exposure to household air pollution and out of pocket expenses for any antenatal and postnatal care seeking (Table1).,1
"Caption (TABLE-WRAP): TABLE 1\n\nSchedule of enrolment, interventions, and assessments\n\nElectronic data collection tool\nData will be captured using an android application developed using Java.",1
Each data collector will use Samsung Galaxy 7\xa0in.,1
tablet with Internet enabled SIM card for data collection and transmission of data from the community to central database server.,1
The application will navigate the data collectors through a step-by-step process while interviewing the pregnant women to collect all required information to be collected at each specific visit.,1
Some validation rules will be set in the application to prevent errors during data collection.,1
"Rules will include logical and range checks, uniqueness check and skipping rules as appropriate.",1
"Initially, the Field Implementers will enter all the required registration information of the woman into the system.",1
"As soon as the data is uploaded to the server, information will be passed to the separate evaluation team for first follow up visit.",1
Each data collector will need to log into the system using a pre-assigned unique user ID and password.,1
"During the first visit, the data collector will download the details of the newly registered pregnant women for her assigned cluster from the central server.",1
"This information, filtered according to the geographical area, comes from the registration data collected by the Field Implementers.",1
"During the subsequent visits, the app will provide each data collector with a list of women, for whom a follow-up visit is scheduled within seven days.",1
We will use different colour coding to highlight visits that are pending or imminent.,1
To verify physical presence of the data collectors at the households we will record a Geographic Information System (GIS) data point.,1
The system will also generate daily reports of the completed interviews and enrolment and make them available on the online monitoring interface (in real time).,1
"At the end of each interview, the data collector will store the data on the local device and then upload the data to the central server after the end of a dayâ€™s work.",1
We will maintain a backup copy of the database on a different server.,1
Statistical analysis\nData analysis will be by intention to treat.,1
We will conduct analyses at the infant level adjusted for the cluster randomisation.,1
The primary analyses will compare the neonatal mortality rates and their 95% confidence intervals adjusted for clustering and groundwater iron level in each group.,1
Secondary analyses will examine each outcome variable using separate mixed models.,1
We will use Cox proportional hazards mixed models for mortality outcomes and include groundwater iron level as an interaction term in the mortality model.,1
"We will use population average Poisson model for other outcomes including preterm, small for gestation and low birth weights.",1
"Models will include treatment group as a fixed effect, community-cluster as a random effect to account for the cluster effect.",1
We will check the model assumptions and make appropriate adjustments to the analysis where necessary.,1
Descriptive analysis will be performed to present the cause of death.,1
"We will compare the causes of death by sex of newborn, the time-period of death, and treatment arms (intervention Vs control).",1
Ï‡2test or Fisherâ€™s Exact test after adjusting for cluster effect will be used when appropriate.,1
The economic analysis will estimate the incremental cost per life saved per year of the intervention over standard care.,1
We will use sensitivity analyses of the findings to assess uncertainty in key parameters.,1
Stata V.14 (StataCorp.,1
2015,1
Stata Statistical Software: Release 14.,1

will be used for all analyses.,1
"Data monitoring\n\nElectronic data monitoring tool\nWe will develop an online monitoring system, which will provide us real-time information on enrolment status, adherence of the data collectors with the evaluation schedule and quality of data for key variables.",1
This system will allow the field supervisors to monitor the performance of individual data collectors.,1
All reports will be auto-generated from the system and will be available anytime for the investigatorsâ€™ assessment.,1
"Data safety and monitoring board\nThe research team will establish an independent data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) consisting of an independent paediatrician, a clinical trial specialist and a biostatistician.",1
"This DSMB is responsible for assessing the interim data, data quality, data completeness, adequacy of compliance with goals for recruitment and retention, and factors that might affect the study outcome or compromise the confidentiality of the trial data.",1
Any unintended effects of trial intervention will also be notified to data safety and monitoring board.,1
"Advisory committee\nTo facilitate the overall implementation process and to engage policymakers and other key decision makers, we will establish a national project advisory committee consisting of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare staff, staff, representatives from UNICEF, WHO, the Obstetric and Gynaecological, the Perinatal, and the Nutrition Societies of Bangladesh.",1
This committee will assist in translating the Shonjibon study findings into policy.,1
"In addition, we will establish five district advisory committees consisting of local health officers, local government officials, local community groups, other relevant NGOs and project staff to help guide the research team.",1
Access to data\nAll collected data will be accessible by the study investigators.,1
All the investigators will have the right to analyse and publish data.,1
"We will only share datasets with all personally identifiable information removed, and every reasonable effort to keep the identification of study subjects in the strictest confidence.",1
Dissemination plan\nThe research team will share the lessons learned from the study widely throughout Bangladesh and among global audiences.,1
The authors will organise dissemination seminars to share the findings with all relevant stakeholders.,1
"We will present the intermediate and immediate results, which support the hypotheses generated from the trial, at national and international conferences and publish them in conference proceedings.",1
"We will publish the analysis of the outcomes in the form of internal documents, working papers, and in international peer-reviewed journals.",1
Authorship eligibility will be based on recommendation from International committee for medical journals editors (ICMJE).,1
"In resource-poor countries, rates of maternal anaemia remain high.",1

PubMed Central:,1
"Infant stool samples were collected from 145 infants, and maternal prenatal diet was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire.",1
We used targeted sequencing of the 16S rRNA V4-V5 hypervariable region to characterize infant gut microbiota.,1
"To account for differences in baseline and trajectories of infant gut microbial profiles, we stratified analyses by delivery mode.",1
"Results\nWe identified three infant gut microbiome clusters, characterized by increased abundance of Bifidobacterium , Streptococcus and Clostridium , and Bacteroides , respectively, overall and in the vaginally delivered infant stratum.",1
"In infants delivered by Cesarean section, we identified three clusters that differed slightly from vaginally delivered infants, which were characterized by a high abundance of Bifidobacterium , high Clostridium and low Streptococcus and Ruminococcus genera, and high abundance of the family Enterobacteriaceae .",1
"Electronic supplementary material\nThe online version of this article (10.1186/s40168-018-0490-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",1
"In addition, studies in humans and humanized gnotobiotic mice show that diets with reduced carbohydrates [4], or high in polysaccharides, alter gut microbiome composition [5].",1
Results\n\nStudy population\nCharacteristics of the study population are summarized in Table\xa01( n \u2009=\u2009145).,1
"Maternal age ranged from 22 to 44\xa0years, with an average of 31.9\xa0years.",1
"More than 70% of mothers in the population had at least a college degree, more than 90% were married, and most were first-time mothers.",1
"Smoking during pregnancy was rare at 4.8%, and the population was slightly overweight with an average pre-pregnancy BMI of 25.6.",1
"Our population had more male infants than female infants (57.2% males), and an average birth weight and gestational age of 3427\xa0g and 39.3\xa0weeks, respectively.",1
Most infants were born vaginally (66.9%) and were exclusively breastfed (70.3%) at 6\xa0weeks of age.,1
Daycare attendance and infant antibiotic exposure at or before 4\xa0months of age were rare.,1
Measures and distributions of maternal prenatal diet are shown in Table\xa01.,1
Most subject characteristics and maternal dietary factors were not different between delivery mode groups (Table\xa01).,1

Methods\n\nStudy population\nSubjects for the present study were from the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS) who provided infant stool samples at 6-week postpartum.,1
"As described previously [27,28], eligible participants for the NHBCS are pregnant women obtaining prenatal care in New Hampshire, US clinics, who reported relying on a private, unregulated well as their home water source.",1
Participants between 18 and 45\xa0years old were recruited between 24 and 28\xa0weeks of gestation.,1
The Center for the Protection of Human Subjects at Dartmouth provided institutional review board approval.,1
All methods were carried out in accordance with the guidelines.,1
Written informed consent was obtained for participation from all subjects for themselves and their children.,1
"Between 31 March 2011 when the first potential subject with the opportunity to collect a 6-week infant stool sample from was screened for eligibility and 30 June 2015 when the data were frozen for this analysis, 6569 women were screened for eligibility and 1334 were eligible.",1
"Nine hundred seventy-six subjects were enrolled and 361 provided 6-week infant stool samples, 187 of which had 16S rRNA gene sequencing data available (Additional\xa0file\xa01: Figure S2).",1
"Telephone interviews conducted every 4\xa0months ascertained the infantâ€™s feeding method, including the timing of breastfeeding cessation and the start date of each new formula, as applicable, as well as medication use such as antibiotics.",1
"Infants reported to have never been introduced to formula and to be breastfed were considered to be exclusively breastfed, while those who were ever breastfed and ever formula-fed were considered to be fed with a combination of breast milk and formula regardless of whether or not the infant was still breastfed at the time of stool collection.",1
Those who were never breastfed and only received formula were considered exclusively formula-fed.,1
"The delivery mode was drawn from maternal delivery records, and maternal pre-pregnancy height, weight, and parity were determined via a self-administered questionnaire upon study entry and used to compute pre-pregnancy BMI.",1
Maternal dietary data and Mediterranean diet score\nMaternal diet during pregnancy was assessed during gestational weeks 24â€“28 with a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) [25].,1
"We computed the alternative Mediterranean diet (aMED) score based on FFQ-derived measures of daily food intake, following the method of Tobias et al.",1
"2012 [29], excluding alcohol consumption to adapt the score to a pregnant cohort.",1
"Daily consumption of vegetables, fruits, legumes, soy, and\xa0nuts, whole grains, fish and seafood, and monounsaturated to saturated fat ratio (MUFA:SFA) above the median is considered healthful and confers 1 point to the aMED score.",1
"Red and processed meat intake is considered less healthful, and consumption below the median confers 1 point to the aMED score.",1
"This results in possible aMED score values from 0 to 7, with a higher score indicating greater adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern.",1
"We additionally considered each of those dietary components and maternal dairy, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) intakes separately.",1
Sample collection and DNA extraction\nInfant stool samples were collected at the 6-week maternal postpartum follow-up appointment and were aliquoted and frozen at âˆ’\u200980\xa0Â°C within 24\xa0h. Following established methods reviewed by Wu et al.,1
"[30], we used the Zymo DNA extraction kit (Zymo Research) to extract microbial DNA from thawed samples and quantified the DNA using OD260/280 nanodrop.",1
"Targeted 16S rRNA gene sequencing\nThe V4-V5 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was sequenced at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, MA, using established methods [31,32].",1
"As described previously [24], 16S rDNA V4-V5 amplicons were generated from purified genomic DNA samples using fusion primers.",1
The use of forward primers containing one of eight five-nucleotide barcodes between the Illumina-specific bridge and sequencing primer regions and the 16S-specific region and a single reverse primer containing 1 of 12 Illumina indices enables 96 samples per lane multiplexing.,1
Amplifications were done in triplicate with one negative control for internal quality control at the MBL.,1
"We used qPCR (Kapa Biosystems) to quantify the amplicon pool, and one Illumina MiSeq 500\xa0cycle paired-end run to sequence each pool of 96 libraries.",1
We demultiplexed and divided datasets using Illumina MiSeq Reporter and a custom Python script.,1
"Microbiome profiling\nTo identify microbial population structure profiles, we used full-length amplicon sequences for the rRNA gene V4-V5 hypervariable regions.",1
"We merged the forward and reverse reads based on sequence overlap [33], removed the primer sequences, and discarded the sequences containing any ambiguous nucleotides.",1
We used vsearch [34] to remove chimeras both de novo and in comparison to the RDP classifier training reference.,1
Data processing and statistical analysis\nWe identified open reference operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using QIIME version 1.9.1 [35] with the UCLUST algorithm and 97% similarity [36].,1
"We used PyNAST alignment [37] with Greengenes core reference [38,39] to build OTU tables and assign taxonomy [39,40].",1
Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the FastTree method [41].,1
Subsequent analyses were performed using R version 3.2.2 [42].,1
We computed generalized UniFrac distances between pairs of samples using OTU tables and the midpoint rooted phylogenetic tree.,1
"Generalized UniFrac unifies weighted and unweighted UniFrac to detect differences in moderately abundant lineages instead of those exclusively in highly abundant or rare lineages [43,44].",1
"Of 187 infant stool samples with available sequencing data, we dropped 18 for missing maternal FFQ data, 14 for missing infant feeding method, and 7 for missing maternal BMI.",1
"We dropped three samples of low quality, with read counts <\u20095000, yielding a final sample size of 145 (Additional\xa0file\xa01: Figure S2), with 97 vaginally delivered infants and 48 delivered by Cesarean section.",1
Primary analyses were of vaginally delivered infants.,1
"We tested the contribution of maternal dietary measures (as continuous variables) to the infant microbiome at 6\xa0weeks using the adonis function in the R package vegan [45] with 10,000 permutations.",1
This is a nonparametric permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) test that partitions a distance matrix by sources of variation and can accept both categorical and continuous variables.,1
"We performed crude and adjusted analyses for each dietary food group variable individually, normalized by maternal calorie consumption, and maternal aMED score and MUFA:SFA ratio in vaginally delivered infants.",1
All dietary variables were modeled as continuous variables.,1
"Accordingly, we adjusted for feeding method (exclusively breastfed, combination fed, exclusively formula fed), maternal BMI (continuous), parity (continuous), and batch and performed a sensitivity analysis in exclusively breastfed infants.",1
We considered p \u2009<\u20090.05 to be significant.,1
"To visualize the results, we performed principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) on generalized UniFrac distances using the cmdscale function in R [42] and plotted the samples by the first two coordinates, colored by each dietary variable tertile to aid in visualization.",1
Inspired by the work identifying adult enterotypes by Arumugam et al.,1
[46] and Wu et al.,1
"[47], we identified clusters of the infant gut microbiome at 6\xa0weeks of age using the partitioning around medoids (PAM) method of clustering on generalized UniFrac distances.",1
We identified clusters in all infants ( n \u2009=\u2009145) and within infants delivered vaginally ( n \u2009=\u200997) or by Cesarean section ( n \u2009=\u200948) for within delivery group analyses.,1
"We used the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters, which is based on the within-cluster sum of squares.",1
The outcome in each model was the infant gut microbiome cluster membership; cluster 1 was used as the reference in all models.,1
We computed the relative abundance for each OTU by dividing the read count in each cell by the total number of reads in the sample and filtered out OTUs with zero or near-zero variance using the caret package in R. This results in 624 OTUs.,1
We used a zero replacement procedure and log-ratio transformation to account for the zero-inflated and compositional nature of the data [48] before running linear models.,1
We adjusted p values for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini and Hochberg method to control the false discovery rate [49].,1
"In reporting the results, we use the lowest level of assigned taxonomy available, which is most commonly the genus, but ranges from the family to the species level.",1
"For sensitivity, we repeated analyses (1) excluding infants with possible antibiotic exposure ( nvaginal\u2009=\u20093, nCesarean\u2009=\u20092) and those with missing antibiotic exposure information ( nvaginal\u2009=\u20093, nCesarean\u2009=\u20092) and (2) excluding all infants delivered before 37\xa0weeks gestation ( n \u2009=\u20098), reported in the supplemental information.",1
We also report unadjusted estimates for analyses and analyses further adjusted for infant age at sample collection in the supplemental information.,1

"Japanese Black cattle breed has the highest IMF content in the world, and Korean cattle (also called Hanwoo) the second highest.",1
Castration of bulls increases IMF deposition in most cattle breeds.,1
Application of fetal nutritional programming to increase IMF deposition of progeny in later life is reviewed.,1
"In particular, stage-specific feeding programs with concentrate-based diets developed by Japan and Korea are described in this article.",1
"For example, beef with higher IMF produces higher sensory traits, including tenderness, juiciness, flavor, and overall acceptability in Korean cattle [2] and in USA beef samples [3].",1
Most marbling fat is deposited between muscle fibre bundles in the perimysial connective tissue in beef cattle [4].,1
Marbling adipocytes are also found within muscle bundles in the longissimus dorsi muscle (LM) of high-quality grade Japanese Black cattle [5].,1
"Our laboratory has studied IMF deposition for more than a decade to understand the mechanisms responsible for IMF deposition in beef cattle [6â€“12], and we have reviewed molecular mechanisms responsible for IMF deposition in cattle [13].",1
"In this review, we first provide an overview of muscle and fat cell growth in ruminants.",1
"OVERVIEW OF MUSCLE AND FAT CELL GROWTH IN RUMINANTS\nSkeletal muscle including the LM mainly consists of skeletal muscle fibres (myofibres), but it also contains fat cells, connective tissue or extracellular matrix, and various other cell types including satellite cells, immune cells and blood vessels.",1
The ratio of muscle to fat cells varies depending on the amount of IMF deposited.,1
"Muscle and fat cell growth typically occur as mass increases due to both hyperplasia (increase in cell number) and hypertrophy (increase in cell size) [14,15].",1
"Muscle and fat cell development are dependent on myogenesis (muscle cell formation) and adipogenesis (fat cell formation), respectively [16].",1
The process of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue development during the fetal stage in laboratory animals and livestock including ruminants has been well described in reviews by Du et al [16â€“18].,1
"Then, myogenic progenitor cells further develop into muscle fibres and satellite cells, while adipogenicâ€“fibrogenic progenitor cells develop into the stromalâ€“vascular fraction of skeletal muscle, where adipocytes, fibroblasts, and resident adipogenicâ€“fibrogenic progenitor cells reside [16].",1
"Adipogenesis is a comprehensive term that includes commitment of mesenchymal stem cells to preadipocytes, determination and proliferation of preadipocytes, and differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes [19].",1
Adipogenesis normally begins around mid-gestation in ruminant animals [20].,1
Differentiation of adipogenic cells occurs during fetal and postnatal stages.,1
"In the fetal stage, the main process is increasing the number of adipocytes (hyperplasia) derived from adipogenicâ€“fibrogenic progenitor cells [21].",1
"Hyperplasia of fat cells mainly occurs from conception until birth, and hypertrophy is a greater contributor to IMF deposition than is hyperplasia from 250 d of age to slaughter [16,17].",1
"After birth, the adipogenicâ€“fibrogenic progenitor cells re main on some parts of the stromal vascular cells in adipose tissue, later serving as precursors to preadipocytes and adipocytes [16,22].",1
"Then, preadipocytes can differentiate during the finishing stage when they fill with lipid to grow into visible marbling by hypertrophy.",1
"Four major adipose tissue depots exist in animals: ab dominal, subcutaneous, intermuscular, and intramuscular.",1
Adipogenesis in beef cattle is first initiated in abdominal (visceral) adipocytes around mid-gestation [16].,1
"According to Du et al [16], this adipogenesic phase extends to the neonatal period for abdominal adipocytes, to the early weaning stage for subcutaneous and intermuscular adipocytes, and to around 250 d of age for IMF.",1
"The LM of Wagyu contains the highest fat content (36.5%: average value from two publications [25,26]), and the LM from Korean cattle contains the second highest fat content worldwide (13.7%: average value from four publications [10,27â€“29]), followed by Angus (9.3%: average value from three publications [30â€“32]), Hereford crossbred or Hereford (7.6%: average value from two publications [30,33]), and Brahman (2.8%: average value from four publications [32,34â€“36]) (Table 1).",1
"In Korean cattle, Park et al [39] compared marbling degree by sex (bulls, steers, and cows), and steers had the best MS, followed by cows.",1
"They reported that the average breed type list included purebred or crossbred Angus, Brahman, Simmental, Charolais, Hereford, Jersey, Korean Brown cattle, Maine Anjou, Pinzgauer, Sahiwal, Salers, and South Devon with estimates MS heritability of 0.37 (range 0.30 to 0.57).",1
MS heritability is relatively high in Korean cattle (0.57 in Yoon et al [42]; 0:64 in Park et al [43]).,1
"The heritability marbling phenotype in Japanese Wagyu is 0.40 to 0.55 [44â€“46], and MS heritabilities in Angus and Brahman are 0.48 [47] and 0.37 to 0.44 [48,49], respectively.",1
"The study was conducted with steer of three genotypes (Angus, Hereford and WagyuÃ—Angus): Angus was targeting high IMF and high subcutaneous fat, Hereford was targeting low IMF and high subcutaneous fat, and Wagyu sires Angus dams were targeting high IMF and lower subcutaneous fat.",1
"The P8 rump fat depth was generally greater in Hereford than Angus, and Meat Standard Australia (MSA) MS was generally lower in Hereford than in Angus and WagyuÃ—Angus.",1
"In two separate studies, early-weaned steers (weaned at 177 d [study 1] and 158 d [study 2] of age and placed on a finishing diet) increased MS and body weight gain, improved feed efficiency, and improved QG of the beef compared with normally weaned steers or normally weaned steers supplemented with grain [51].",1
"In these studies, the normally weaned steers remained on pasture during nursing and weaning at 231 d (study 1) and 213 d of age (study 2), respectively, and they were then placed on a finishing diet.",1
"The steers of the normally weaned steers supplemented with grain were raised under the same conditions as the normally weaned animals, but they were supplemented with grain for 55 d on pasture (study 1, 177 to 231 d of age; study 2, 158 to 213 d of age).",1
"In their study, early weaning calves (123 d of age; 145 kg of body weight) were compared with conventional weaning animals (259 d of age; 273 kg of body weight) in contemporary feeding management.",1
"Early weaned- animals showed lighter final body weight, and tended to eat less than conventionally weaned- animals.",1
Another study in Angus and Wagyu cross heifers raised under early weaning (142 days old) and accelerated finishing programs on a high concentrate diet showed increased IMF and greater weight gain compared with heifers weaned at 180 d of age and grown on pasture for 16 months before entering the feedlot [53].,1
A study was performed to understand the mechanism re sponsible for improved MS after early weaning and high-concentrate feeding in Angus and Angus Ã— Simmental steers [55].,1
Early weaning (141 d of age) followed by a high-starch diet improved MS compared with normal weaning (222 d of age) followed by a starch creep-feed diet.,1
"In another study, Graugnard et al [56] reported that a high-starch diet induced precocious upregulation of the adipogenic gene network in the longissimus lumborum of early-weaned (average 155 d) Angus cattle.",1
"Two-week-old Korean cattle calves were fed different diets, i.e., motherâ€™s milk+roughage (control), milk replacement+concentrate, milk replacement+concentrate+roughage, and milk replacement+ concentrate+30% starch [58].",1
"All calves were then fed the same diet for 22 months, and muscle tissues were collected by biopsy.",1
"The RNA-Seq transcriptome and KEGG pathway analyses of differentially expressed genes showed that pathways for PPAR signaling, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (FA), and Wnt signaling changed in the milk replacement+concentrate+roughage group compared with those in the control group, whereas the milk replacement+concentrate+30% starch diet group showed changes in insulin signaling and mTOR signaling pathways.",1
The milk replacement+concentrate+roughage group and the milk replacement+concentrate group showed changes in the adipokine signaling pathway compared to control group.,1
"Castration of bulls profoundly increased MS, QG, and IMF contents in Korean cattle [9,39].",1
"The castration rate of bulls has been increasing in Korea in the 21st century, and it was about 95% in 2013 [59].",1
"Five QG levels are used in the Korean beef QG system [QG1++ (highest), QG1+, QG1, QG2, and QG3 (lowest)] [59].",1
Castration also increased MS in Canadian beef carcasses [60].,1
Japanese Black cattle bulls are normally castrated to get highly marbled beef in Japan [61].,1
"Castration is also known to increase tenderness in several cattle breeds, including Korean cattle [62], Angus and Angusâ€“Hereford cross breeds [63], and Brahman and Charolais cross breeds [64].",1
Slaughter age\nIMF content increases with increasing age in most cattle breeds.,1
"The IMF content in the LM of somatic-cell-cloned Japanese black steers increased with age at slaughter: 20 (23.7%), 25 (38.7%), and 30 months (41.1%) [65].",1
"Purebred Japanese Black cattle show a linear increase in IMF content with increasing slaughter age from 16.7 months (500 d) to over 33.3 months (1,000 d) [66].",1
MS increased with increasing slaughter age from 16.2 months (485 d) to 20.3 months (610 d) in Holstein-Friesian and Norwegian dairy breeds [67].,1
"In Angus, Hereford, and WagyuÃ—Angus, the IMF contents in the 5 muscles ( biceps femoris , supraspinatus , semitendinosus , longissimus lumborum , and infraspinatus ) and MSA MS increased with the increasing slaughter stages (0, 168, 326, 431 and 585 d after weaning) [30].",1
"Both MS and IMF contents increased with increasing slaughter age (2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 months) in bulls of German Angus, Galloway, and Holstein-Friesian breeds [24].",1
The MS standard ranges from 1 to 9 in Korea [59].,1
The MS of Korean cattle steers (81 animals) raised at the Livestock Improvement Main Center of the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation in Korea increased from 6.0 to 7.06 as slaughter age increased from 26 to 31 months [68].,1
The highest profit in this steer group was for a slaughter age of 31 months.,1
"In the same report [68], the MS in 5,826 Korean cattle steers from several farms in Gangwon Province was analyzed in 2010 to 2012; MS increased from 4.9 to 5.7 as slaughter age increased from 26 to 35 months.",1
"In this case, the optimum slaughter age for the highest profit was 28 months.",1
"A linear increase in IMF content was observed in British and Japanese BlackÃ—Holstein-type cattle during a long fattening period in a feedlot, as carcass weight increased from 200 to 400 kg (reviewed in Pethick et al [69]).",1
The MS and IMF content in Angus steers increases in a linear fashion with increasing HCW from 208 to 380 kg [72].,1
"In the same study, LM area also increased linearly with increasing HCW.",1
The IMF of Angus steers grown in South Dakota (USA) increased linearly with increasing HCW from 189 to 368 kg (live weight from 340 to 591 kg) [73].,1
"In pooled data of different sexes (cows, bulls, and steers) of Korean cattle, MS and LM area increased with increasing carcass weight from 143 to 536 kg [39].",1
"IMF contents in the 5 muscles ( biceps femoris , supraspinatus , semitendinosus , longissimus lumborum , and infraspinatus ) also increased along with the increase of HCW at 5 slaughter stages in Angus (from 114.8 to 459.1 kg), Hereford (from 114.0 to 452.2 kg), and WagyuÃ—Angus (from 116.8 to 459.2 kg) [30].",1
Feed efficiency decreases as animal age and slaughter weight exceed a certain level.,1
"In particular, exposing feedlot animals to hot or cold stress reduces growth and feed efficiency [75].",1
"Cold stress during winter decreases animal performance and production efficiency [76,77].",1
British and BritishÃ—Continental crossbred cattle grown with no shelter or windbreak had greater fat thickness and MS in winter than did animals fed in a protected area [74].,1
The YG was lowest in winter and highest in spring and summer.,1
"In contrast, backfat thickness, which is a negative YG factor, was highest in winter.",1
"In same study, neither MS nor QG was associated with air temperature.",1
"Fat synthesis and degradation metabolism\nIMF deposition results from a balance among uptake, synthesis, and degradation of triglycerides (TGs).",1
TG synthesis is a key factor for IMF deposition [69].,1
Both non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) and a glycerol backbone are required for TG synthesis.,1
"The FA de novo synthesis occurs mainly in adipose tissue in ruminants [84], whereas it occurs in the liver in humans and rodents.",1
FA for TG synthesis is derived from de novo synthesis or diet-originating FAs.,1
The de novo FA synthesis pathway of ruminants is summarized inFigure 3.,1
Acetate or glucose is used as a substrate for FA synthesis [85].,1
"The predominant substrate for FA synthesis in ruminants is acetate, which is mainly derived from ruminal fermentation.",1
Glucose can also be used as a substrate for FA de novo synthesis in ruminants.,1
Glucose is derived from either glucose synthesis via gluconeogenesis from propionate/lactate or glucose absorbed from the small intestinal digestion of the rumen bypass [86].,1
ATP citrate and NADP malate dehydrogenase are two key enzymes utilizing glucose in the FA de novo synthesis pathway.,1
These two enzymes are induced in adipose tissues of ruminants by increasing energy intake [89].,1
"In addition, IMF has higher ATP-citrate lyase activity compared to subcutaneous fat [90].",1
"Furthermore, IMF has a higher expression of glucose transporter 4, which is responsible for uptake of glucose in adipose tissues, compared to subcutaneous fat (reviewed in [90]).",1
"Fatty acids of dietary origin are obtained from transporta tion of TG lipoprotein and subsequent uptake after lipoprotein lipase hydrolysis into tissues from the circulation [92,93].",1
Feeding high-oil corn (1.3% more total lipid than typical corn) enhanced IMF deposition in predominantly Angus finishing crossbred steers [94].,1
"In addition to FAs, a glycerol â€œbackboneâ€, mainly supplied by glucose, is needed for TG synthesis.",1
Proliferative potential is lower in intramuscular preadipocytes than in subcutaneous preadipocytes [97].,1
IMF also has lower lipogenic activity than does subcutaneous fat [98].,1
"Our research also showed that IMF had the lowest transcriptional activity for many adipose development and lipid metabolism genes, including adipogenesis, FA transport, lipogenesis, lipolysis, and FA oxidation among several fat depots (abdominal, perirenal, subcutaneous, and intramuscular) of Korean cattle [7].",1
"TG hydrolysis by lipolysis generates NEFAs and glycerol, and it decreases IMF deposition, as lipolysis is a fat mobilisation pathway.",1
"Stress increases circulating concentrations of cortisol, a typical stress marker [99].",1
Cold stress stimulates lipolysis by increasing the secretion of stress hormones including epinephrine and norepinephrine in humans [101].,1
Cold stress causes white fat depot lipolysis in rats [102].,1
"Feeding medium-chain TGs, such as coconut oil increased the lipid content in the liver and carcasses of Holstein calves under cold stress [104].",1
"Fat digestion and absorption\nMany of the FAs generated by digestion in the rumen pass into the small intestine, where they are absorbed into circulation via the lymph and blood.",1
"Most (~90%) dietary lipids reach the duodenum as NEFAs, unless they are protected [105].",1
"Protected dietary fats are bypassed in the rumen without digestion, and they are digested and absorbed in the small intestine.",1
"Emulsifier supplementation increased digestion and absorption of a high energy/fat diet in ruminants [106,107].",1
The emulsifier PROSOL (sodium stearoyl-2-lactylate) increases IMF deposition and QG in Korean cattle [108].,1
"Bile salts are amphipathic compounds that act as biological detergents, converting dietary fats into mixed micelles of bile salts and TGs [109].",1
"Micelle formation profoundly increases the fraction of lipid molecules accessible to the action of intestinal lipase, aiding fat digestion in the intestine.",1
"Ursodeoxycholic acid, which is a bile acid, is synthesized chemically from cholic acid.",1
Increasing digestion of rumen-bypassed starch in the small intestine helps increase the glucose supply.,1
Harmon and McLeod [111] reported that starch digestion is more efficient in the small intestine than during fermentation in the rumen: the total energetic efficiency of rumen-fermented starch was about 73% that of small intestine-digested starch.,1
The decreased flake thickness of steam-flaked sorghum increased starch digestion and liver gluconeogenesis [114].,1
"Steam flaking further increases marbling in cases of maize and sorghum, and is more effective for sorghum.",1
"Yearling BrangusÃ—HerefordÃ— Angus steers fed a high grain diet (79% corn) had more growth performance, greater MS, and higher grade meat than did steers fed a forage diet (winter wheat pasture with sorghum-Sudan and Bermuda grass pasture) [117].",1
"Increasing the percentage of concentrate (60%, 75%, and 90% concentrate) in growing diets increased MS in steers [118].",1
"Pooled results from Angus, Shorthorn, Murray Grey, and Hereford showed that the grain-finishing group had a greater IMF% than the grass-finishing group [115].",1
The IMF contents in longissimus lumborum and semitendinosus muscle were higher in high-concentrate-fed than in low-concentrate-fed BarrosÃ£ bulls.,1
American Wagyu steers fed a high-corn diet had greater fat accumulation than did animals fed a hay-based diet [120].,1
Steers were fed the same total digestible nutrient (TDN) but different dietary roughage/concentrate ratios (low-concentrate group: 35% roughage and 65% concentrate; high-concentrate group: 10% roughage and 90% concentrate).,1
The IMF content in the LM of the high-concentrate group (31.7% Â±5.4%) was greater than that in the low-concentrate group (22.9%Â±5.3%).,1
"Podolian bulls fed grazing pasture and fed a high protein (15% CP, DM basis) supplement had higher IMF content in the LM than did animals grazing pasture and fed a low protein (12% CP) supplement [126].",1
Japanese Black steers fed a 16% CP diet had greater backfat thickness than those fed a 12% CP diet [127].,1
Vitamin A\nRestricting vitamin A intake increases IMF deposition.,1
Vitamin A (also known as retinol) inhibits adipocyte differentiation [128].,1
"The activity of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a biomarker for adipogenesis, decreases in bovine preadipocytes cultured with retinol [129].",1
A study of Angus-crossbred steers showed that animals not supplemented with vitamin A had higher MS and QG compared to vitamin A-supplemented animals [132].,1
"The same authors reported that exclusion of a vitamin A supplement induced hyperplasia in IMF, but not in the subcutaneous fat depot.",1
The lack of vitamin A supplementation also increased marbling compared with vitamin A supplementation in a study of Angus crossbred steers [133].,1
Retinoic acid positively regulates growth hormone gene expression [135] and decreases fat deposition and IMF in steers [136].,1
Kawachi [137] described that the plasma retinol level in Japanese fattening cattle is about 300 Î¼g/L (100 IU/dL) and that a vitamin A-deficient diet decreases the plasma concentration to <90 Î¼g/L (30 IU/dL).,1
"Alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH) is the primary enzyme that oxidizes retinol to retinaldehyde [138], and retinaldehyde inhibits adipocyte differentiation [139].",1
The cattle with a TT genotype (approximately 6.15%) that were not supplemented with vitamin A had 22.9% greater IMF compared with those with the CC genotype (approximately 4.95%).,1
Vitamin A-unsupplemented TT steers (approximately 6.15%) had 24.4% greater IMF content compared with supplemented TT steers (approximately 4.9%).,1
Vitamin D\nVitamin D also inhibits adipogenesis in vitro .,1
"1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3(active form of vitamin D) inhibits preadipocyte differentiation [141] and suppresses adipogenic PPARG gene expression in 3T3 L1 cells [142].",1
"Vitamin C\nVitamin C can be synthesized from glucose in the liver of many mammalian species other than guinea pigs, humans, and other primates [146].",1
Vitamin C or L-ascorbic acid has several roles including in oxidationâ€“reduction reactions and collagen synthesis [147].,1
In vivo studies showed increased marbling in response to dietary vitamin C supplementation in beef cattle; dietary supplementation of rumen-protected l-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate during the final fattening period increased both MS and fat content in carcasses of Japanese Black cattle [150].,1
Supplementing rumen-protected vitamin C in a high sulfur diet increased the MS and the percentage of Choice grade beef in Angus cross steers [151].,1
"Negative maternal energy status at mid-gestation (80% of the energy requirements for maintenance of body weight) did not affect MS, intramuscular fat percentage, and HCW, but increased the ratio of MS to 12th rib fat thickness and the ratio of percent intramuscular fat to 12th rib fat thickness in offspring compared with positive energy status [154].",1
"Fetal programming of nutritional restriction with pasture-based systems retarded offspring growth performance (body weight, feed intake, carcass weight) and production parameters including muscle weight, meat yield, and fat and bone weight at any given age.",1
The dams were limited in their feed to maintain similar energy intake among the groups.,1
"In the study, steers from dams fed a corn-based diet during late gestation had a lower MS compared with progeny from dams fed diets low in starch (grass hay or dried corn distillers grains with solubles).",1
"Stage-specific feeding systems\nA significant proportion of consumers in Korea, Japan, and the USA prefer highly marbled beef to minimally marbled beef.",1
Japan and Korea have developed stage-specific feeding systems to produce highly marbled beef.,1
The feeding system for highly marbled beef from Japanese Black cattle has been described previously in a review by Gotoh et al [95].,1
"Briefly, Japanese Black cattle are generally fed a high concentrate diet from 11 to 30 months of age to induce deposition of IMF.",1
The concentrate constitutes 36.8% to 86.4% of feed from 11 to 18 months of age.,1
"During the final stage, from 18 months to slaughter (28 to 30 months of age), the concentrate is 84.2% to 86.4% of feed, and the rest is roughage (rice straw).",1
"The Korean Feeding Standard for Hanwoo [160] describes how to feed Korean cattle at each stage (growth, early fattening, and late fattening stages).",1
"Briefly, high-quality forage is fed ad libitum to develop the rumen during the growing stage (7 to 12 months of age), and the concentrate (CP 15% to 16%, TDN 69% to 70%) is restricted to 1.5% to 1.6% of body weight at this time.",1
"The fattening period can be divided into early and late periods, during which the concentrate is mainly fed with a small portion of roughage.",1
"Feed comprising about 80% concentrate (1.6% to 1.9% of body weight; CP 12% to 13%, TDN 72% to 73%) is provided during the early fattening stage (13 to 21 months of age).",1
"During the late fattening phase, from 22 months to slaughter age (28 to 31 months of age), about 90% concentrate (CP 11% to 12%, TDN 73% to 74%) is fed, and roughage (rice straw and rye grass) is about 10% of the diet.",1
Korean farmers often feed a total mixed ration during the growing and early finishing stages instead of feeding concentrate and roughage separately.,1
"The mixed ration is made by using agricultural by-products (soybean curd cake and pomace of citrus, apple, and carrot) [96].",1
The current stage-specific feeding program for producing Korean cattle with highly marbled beef relies heavily on feeding a concentrate diet during the fattening period.,1

Methods\nWe conducted a follow up study of infants born to women who participated in the LIMIT trial during pregnancy.,1
"Live-born infants at 6-months of age, and whose mother provided consent to ongoing follow-up were eligible.",1
The primary follow-up study endpoint was the incidence of infant BMI z-score â‰¥90th centile for infant sex and age.,1
"Secondary study outcomes included a range of infant anthropometric measures, neurodevelopment, general health, and infant feeding.",1
Analyses used intention to treat principles according to the treatment group allocated in pregnancy.,1
"Missing data were imputed and analyses adjusted for maternal early pregnancy BMI, parity, study centre, socioeconomic status, age, and smoking status.",1

"Results\nA total of 1754 infants were assessed at age 6 months (Lifestyle Advice n \u2009=\u2009869; Standard Care n \u2009=\u2009885), representing 82.1% of the eligible sample ( n \u2009=\u20092136).",1

"There were no other effects on infant growth, adiposity, or neurodevelopment.",1
Conclusion\nProviding pregnant women who were overweight or obese with an antenatal dietary and lifestyle intervention did not alter 6-month infant growth and adiposity.,1
Trial Registration: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12607000161426).,1
"Introduction\nAcross the globe, >1.46 billion adults [1], and 170 million children [2], are overweight or obese.",1
"Methods\nThe methods and primary clinical findings of the LIMIT randomised trial have been published [21â€“23], with the trial registered on the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12607000161426).",1
"Briefly, we conducted a multicentre randomised trial involving women with a singleton pregnancy, between 10+0and 20+0weeksâ€™ gestation, and body mass index â‰¥25.0\u2009kg/m2, who were randomised to either an antenatal dietary and lifestyle intervention (Lifestyle Advice Group) or standard antenatal care (Standard Care Group) [22].",1
"Women in the Lifestyle Advice group received a comprehensive intervention over the course of their pregnancy that included a combination of dietary, exercise and behavioural strategies, delivered by a research dietician and trained research assistants [22].",1
"Dietary information was consistent with current Australian standards [25], while physical activity advice focussed on the benefits of exercise in pregnancy [26].",1
"Women were encouraged to set achievable goals for change, supported to make these lifestyle changes, to identify potential barriers and enablers to their implementation, and to self-monitor their progress [21,22].",1
"This information was delivered through two dedicated sessions with the research dietician (at trial entry, and 28 weeks) and trained research assistants (via telephone call at 22, 24, and 32 weeks, and a faceâ€“face visit at 36 weeks) [21,22].",1
Study design\nWe conducted follow-up of infants born to women who participated in the LIMIT randomised trial 6-months after birth.,1
"Participants\nWomen who participated in the LIMIT randomised trial, gave birth to a live infant, and who provided consent to the ongoing follow-up of their child, were eligible for inclusion.",1
"Women who suffered a stillbirth or neonatal death, or who withdrew from participation in ongoing follow-up were excluded.",1
"Follow-up schedule\nEach infant was assessed by a research assistant, blinded to the allocated treatment group.",1
"Eligible women were contacted to arrange a follow-up assessment of their child, either at the hospital of their birth, or if more convenient, for a research assistant to visit their home.",1
Primary outcome\nThe primary outcome was the incidence of infant BMI z-score â‰¥90th centile for infant age and sex at follow-up [27].,1
Secondary outcomes\nInfant Anthropometric Measurements: We have an established and validated method of conducting anthropometric measurements in infants [28].,1
"Information obtained included the infantâ€™s length, weight, weight-for-length, and anthropometric measurements (arm, thigh, waist and hip circumferences; biceps, triceps, sub-scapular, abdominal, supra-iliac and thigh skin-fold thickness).",1
"Research assistants used Harpenden skin-fold callipers to obtain skinfold thickness measurements, and received ongoing standardised training [29].",1
"Weight, length, BMI, weight-for-length, and head circumference measures were converted to z-scores for age and gender, using WHO standards [27,30].",1
"Infant Neurodevelopment: The infantâ€™s primary caregiver was asked to complete a structured Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) [31], reporting five domains of development (communication, gross motor, fine motor, problem solving, and personal-social skills).",1
"Possible responses included Yes, Sometimes, or No, with a score in any one domain >2SD below the mean considered indicative of the need for further assessment and when identified, the primary caregiver was advised to seek additional medical advice.",1
"The ASQ has been validated against the Bayley Scales [32], and in a paediatric population [33].",1
"General health, health service utilisation, and quality of life: as assessed by questionnaire [34] completed by the infantâ€™s primary caregiver.",1
"Infant Feeding: (breast, formula, or a combination of the two), as assessed by questionnaire completed by the infantâ€™s primary caregiver.",1
"Sample size\nThe available sample size for follow-up assessment at 6-months of age was predetermined by the LIMIT trial, which was powered on the primary outcome of large for gestational age, with 2212 women randomised [22].",1
"Using data from the general Australian population, we anticipated a minimum incidence in the standard care group of BMI z-score\u2009â‰¥90th centile of approximately 25% [35].",1
A sample size of 1350 infants (75% follow-up) would provide 80% power to detect at least a difference in the incidence of BMI z-score\u2009â‰¥90th centile of 6.4% (from 25 to 18.6%; alpha 0.05).,1
"Detectable differences would range from 6.2% (with follow-up of 80% of children), to 6.7% (with follow-up of 70% of children; alpha 0.05; power 80%).",1
Small but relevant differences of 0.15â€“0.16 standard deviations in secondary continuous outcomes could also be detected.,1
"Statistical analysis\nThe analysis was conducted using intention to treat principles, according to the treatment group the woman was randomised to in pregnancy (Lifestyle Advice or Standard Care).",1
"Missing data were imputed for all randomised participants except those who had no live birth, who had an infant death, or who withdrew from the study and also withdrew permission to use data.",1
"Data were imputed separately by treatment group using the fully conditional specification (chained equations) method to create 100 complete datasets for analysis under the assumption that the data were missing at random (i.e., that â€œmissingnessâ€ was independent of the values of the missing observations, conditional on observed data).",1
"In order to make the MAR assumption more plausible, a range of auxiliary variables, including stratification (centre, parity, BMI category) and adjustment variables (socioeconomic status, smoking, maternal age at consent, infant gender), along with infant birth measures (weight, length, circumferences and skinfold thickness measures), were included in the imputation model.",1
"The results of imputed analyses were compared with those from complete-case analyses, and further sensitivity analyses were also conducted for the primary outcome on the assumption that data were Missing Not At Random (MNAR).",1
"That is, analyses were conducted assuming that missing values had, firstly, a substantially greater incidence, and secondly, a substantially reduced incidence of z-scores\u2009>90th percentile as compared with the observed data.",1
"Both adjusted and unadjusted analyses were performed, with adjustment for variables used to stratify randomisation (maternal early pregnancy BMI category, parity, and centre of birth), in addition to maternal socioeconomic status, age, and smoking status.",1
Infant outcomes other than z-scores were additionally adjusted for gender and actual age at assessment.,1
"For binary outcomes, relative risks with 95% CI were estimated using log binomial regression.",1
"For continuous outcomes, differences in means with 95% CI were estimated using linear regression.",1
Analyses were performed to test for effect modification by maternal BMI category.,1
"Statistical significance was set at p \u2009<\u20090.05 (two-sided) with no adjustment for multiple comparisons, and all analyses followed a pre-specified plan.",1
"Ethics\nApproval was granted by the Womenâ€™s and Childrenâ€™s Local Health Network Human Research and Ethics Committee at the Womenâ€™s and Childrenâ€™s Hospital, the Central Northern Adelaide Health Service Ethics of Human Research Committee (Lyell McEwin Hospital) and the Flinders Clinical Research Ethics Committee (Flinders Medical Centre).",1
All participants provided written informed consent to participate.,1
Results\nFigure\xa01outlines the flow of participants.,1
A total of 2136 infants were eligible for the follow-up study and included in the analysis (96.6% of the randomised sample).,1
"There were 1754 infants who were assessed at 6 months of age (Lifestyle Advice n \u2009=\u2009869; Standard Care n \u2009=\u2009885), representing 82.1% of the eligible sample.",1
"There were five deaths to 6 months of age (4 neonatal deaths as reported previously [22], and the death of one infant prior to 6 months of age attributable to sudden infant death syndrome).",1
"Table\xa01describes the baseline characteristics of the subset of eligible maternal participants, and are similar to the entire randomised cohort (data not shown) [22].",1
"The median BMI of the cohort was 31.0\u2009kg/m2(Inter Quartile Range (IQR) 27.8â€“35.6\u2009kg/m2), with 42.1% of women overweight, and 57.9% obese.",1

"While not all women who participated in this trial were overweight or obese (mean BMI 26.8\u2009kg/m2), there was no evidence of an effect on infant birth weight [16].",1
"Furthermore, follow-up of 280 infants (35% of the randomised cohort) at 6-months of age demonstrated no evidence of an effect of the intervention on early infant measures of growth or adiposity [19].",1
"The UPBEAT trial evaluated the effect of an antenatal dietary and lifestyle intervention among obese women, with no impact on infant birth weight demonstrated [17].",1
Conclusions\nAntenatal dietary and lifestyle advice did not alter infant growth and adiposity at 6-months of age.,1

Pregnant women (<\u200918\xa0weeksâ€™ gestation) ( n \u2009=\u2009250) are being recruited from primary healthcare clinics in Johannesburg and are followed-up at a provincial hospital.,1
"Participantsâ€™ dietary intake and nutrient status (focus on micronutrients and fatty acids) are assessed at <\u200918, 22 and 36\xa0weeksâ€™ gestation.",1
"Additional assessments during pregnancy include anthropometric and blood pressure measurements, obstetric ultrasound screens, and assessments of food security, maternal fatigue, prenatal depression, allergy, immune function, morbidity and gestational diabetes.",1
"At birth, maternal and neonatal health is assessed and an umbilical cord blood sample collected.",1
"Maternal and offspring health is followed-up at 6\xa0weeks, as well as at 6, â‰ˆ7.5 and 12\xa0months after birth.",1
"Follow-up assessments of mothers include anthropometric measures, diet history, nutrient status, blood pressure, breast milk composition, and measures of postnatal depression and fatigue.",1
"Follow-up assessments of the offspring include feeding practices, nutrient status, measures of growth, psychomotor, socio-emotional and immune development, morbidity, allergy, as well as analysis of the gut microbiome and the epigenome.",1
"Apart from the long-term health consequences, severe growth-restricted foetuses are at increased risk of stillbirth, and the live births have an increased risk of neonatal death, morbidity and permanent deficits in growth and neurocognitive development [5,6].",1
"South Africa has large economic disparities and 20% of the population are living in extreme poverty, indicating they cannot afford the minimum required food intake [17].",1
"During a national survey in 2012, approximately 40% of the population were reported to have a monotonous diet based mainly on starches [18].",1
"Hence, not surprisingly, 31% and 13% of South African women of reproductive age are anaemic [22] and vitamin A deficient [18], respectively, while 68% of women are overweight or obese, and 46% hypertensive [22].",1
Both stunting and poverty are known risk factors for poor child development [23].,1
"A simplistic conceptual framework showing the modifiable and non-modifiable exposure variables, as well as the outcome variables that will be determined to achieve the aims, is shown in Fig.",1

1\n\nSimplistic conceptual framework of exposure and outcome variables in the NuPED study.,1
The study investigates the indicated variables from early pregnancy to infants up to 12\xa0months.,1
The variables fall mainly in the modifiable risk factors category with the core interest being nutritional status.,1
"The outcome variables include birth outcomes such as birth weight and gestational age as well as postnatal growth and psychomotor development\n\nMethods/design\n\nStudy design\nThis prospective cohort study follows 250 women throughout pregnancy to birth, and their infants up to 12\xa0months of age.",1
"Briefly, data are collected early pregnancy, mid-pregnancy, late pregnancy and at birth.",1
"Postnatal assessments focus mainly on offspring health and development at 6\xa0weeks, 6\xa0months, 7.5\xa0months (6\xa0months + 6\xa0weeks) and 12\xa0monthsâ€™ postnatal age.",1
Recruitment of participants started on 7 March 2016 and completion of data collection is expected in June 2019.,1
"Setting\nThe study is situated in Johannesburg, the largest city in South Africa.",1
Recruitment of study participants takes place in two of the seven municipal regions of the city from which four primary health care clinics were identified.,1
These clinics fall in the catchment area of Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital (RMMCH).,1
"RMMCH is a provincial hospital focusing on maternal and paediatric healthcare, delivering more than 10,000 babies annually.",1
Pregnancy data are collected at the antenatal care (ANC) clinic of RMMCH in addition to routine care.,1
Birth data are collected in the relevant wards at RMMCH.,1
Postnatal data are collected at the Empilweni Services and Research Unit (ESRU) at RMMCH.,1
The execution of the study is coordinated by the Centre of Excellence for Nutrition of the North-West University.,1
Study population\nThe study population is urban pregnant women attending ANC at either one of four selected primary health care clinics or at the ANC clinic of the hospital.,1
"Women interested to partake in the study are screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, and referred to RMMCH ANC clinic for signing informed consent and data collection if eligible.",1
"The inclusion criteria applied during recruitment screening are: 1) Confirmed pregnancy and planning to deliver her baby at RMMCH; 2) <\u200918\xa0weeksâ€™ gestational age; 3) Born in South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Botswana or Namibia and has been living in South Africa for at least 12\xa0months; 4) Able to communicate effectively in one of the following languages: English, Afrikaans, Sotho, Zulu or Xhosa.",1
"The exclusion criteria are 1) <\u200918 and\u2009>\u200939\xa0years; 2) Multiple pregnancy; 3) Using illicit drugs (self-confessed); 4) Smoking (current and/or in past year); 5) Known non-communicable disease (NCD) namely diabetes, renal disease, high cholesterol, and hypertension; 6) Known infectious disease namely tuberculosis and hepatitis; 7) Known serious illness namely cancer, lupus or psychosis.",1
"Even though women with infectious disease are excluded, women who are HIV positive are still included.",1
"Recruitment and consent procedures\nConsecutive sampling is applied, thus, all accessible pregnant women at the recruitment sites may form part of the sample, if they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, arrive at study site on their booked date and sign informed consent.",1
All pregnant women in the waiting areas of the ANC clinics are informed about the study.,1
"Those interested, receive a study information leaflet and are screened for eligibility individually in a private space upon which a booking date is supplied if eligible.",1
"The informed consent form is given to the participant to read, consider and discuss with her partner and/or family.",1
"Upon arrival at RMMCH on the booked date, the trained fieldworkers explain the informed consent form in local languages and all are given the opportunity to ask questions.",1
All are assured that participation is voluntary and that participation or non-participation in the study will not affect their clinical care.,1
All research participants provide written informed consent before data collection.,1
Written informed consent is again obtained before infant assessments at 6\xa0weeks postnatally.,1
Data collection\nFigure\xa02summarises the measurements and time points of data collection throughout the project.,1
There are eight data collection time points (here forth referred to as phases).,1
All data are collected either by health professionals on site or by trained fieldworkers.,1
Phase 1 data are collected at <\u200918\xa0weeksâ€™ gestation (as confirmed by obstetric ultrasound).,1
These data will supply information on the nutritional status of women early in their pregnancy.,1
"Thus, for practical purposes, the early pregnancy window was set at <\u200918\xa0weeksâ€™ gestation.",1
Phase 2 data are collected at 22\xa0weeksâ€™ gestation (window Â±12\xa0days) when anomaly ultrasounds are typically scheduled.,1
Phase 3 data are collected at 36\xa0weeksâ€™ gestation (window Â±12\xa0days).,1
Study midwifes and/or fieldworkers collect birth data (phase 4) within a window of 12\xa0h. Postnatal data are collected at 6\xa0weeks (+\u200914\xa0days) (phase 5); 24\xa0weeks (+\u200930\xa0days) (phase 6); 6\xa0weeks post measles immunisation (Â± 3\xa0days) (phase 7) or 30\xa0weeks (+\u200930\xa0days) if measles immunization was not given between 24 and 28\xa0weeks; and 52\xa0weeks (+\u200930\xa0days) (phase 8) postnatal age.,1
The purpose of the phase 7 data collection point specifically is to assess measles immunoglobulin G (IgG) as marker of response to immunisation at 6\xa0months and immune function.,1
Caption (FIG): FIG.,1
2\n\nData collection per phase during the NuPED study.,1
Prenatal data collection time points are at <\u200918\xa0weeksâ€™ gestation (phase 1); Â±22\xa0weeksâ€™ gestation (phase 2); Â±36\xa0weeksâ€™ gestation (phase 3) and at birth (phase 4).,1
Postnatal data collection time points are at infant postnatal age of 6\xa0weeks (phase 5); 24\xa0weeks (phase 6); 6\xa0weeks post measles immunisation (Â± 3\xa0days) (phase 7) or 30\xa0weeks (+\u200930\xa0days) if measles immunization was not given between 24 and 28\xa0weeks; and 52\xa0weeks (+\u200930\xa0days) (phase 8).,1
"wks, weeks; d, days, pp, postpartum\n\nMaternal socio-economics and -demographics\nSocio-economic and -demographic data are collected at phase 1 by means of a structured interview.",1
"Data include date and country of birth, marital status, educational level, home language, employment status, household income, number of members in the household, and beneficiaries of social grants.",1
"Lastly, living standards data are obtained to allow classification according to the Living Standards Measure (LSM) developed by the South African Audience Reference Foundation (SAARF) [32].",1
This measure is widely used in South Africa to describe the socio-economic status of the population [33].,1
Maternal household food insufficiency and insecurity\nThe level of the participating womenâ€™s household food insufficiency and insecurity is assessed at phase 1 in pregnancy and again at phases 6 and 8 postnatally.,1
"In a structured interview, women are asked questions on food insecurity and child hunger using the Community Childhood Hunger Identification Project (CCHIP) index [34] that was also used to determine the status of food security in previous national surveys in South Africa [35].",1
"Furthermore, women were asked a validated, single-item question on food insufficiency â€“â€œ How many days in the past week have you gone hungry?",1
By this I mean days when you felt you didnâ€™t have enough to eat .â€â€“that was previously used to determine food insufficiency in pregnant women in South Africa [36].,1
"Maternal dietary intake\nMaternal dietary intake data are obtained by means of two dietary assessment methods, namely the 24-h recall (24-HR) and a quantified food frequency questionnaire (QFFQ).",1
Both methods are interviewer administered by using standardised probing questions [37].,1
"Standard measuring equipment, common size containers (e.g.",1
"cups, bowls and glasses) as well as two- and three-dimensional food models are being used to assist in quantifying portion sizes.",1
"A single 24-HR, which obtains details about nutritional supplement use as well, is administered at phases 1, 2 and 3 in pregnancy, as well as at 6\xa0months postnatally (phase 6).",1
Each participant is requested to recall all foods and drinks consumed the previous day from when she woke up until the next day the same time.,1
The recall is done chronologically unless the participant wishes to recall randomly.,1
The purpose of the single 24-HR is to describe the average intake of the group [38].,1
"All supplement use, as well as food cravings and aversions, are additionally recorded daily by participants on a calendar.",1
"The second dietary assessment method, the QFFQ, is completed at phases 1 and 3.",1
"It was validated for the population in the Transition and Health during Urbanisation of South Africans (THUSA) study [39] and its reproducibility was proven [40,41].",1
It was also used previously to assess individual and total omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid intake in a rural and urban South-African population [42].,1
This QFFQ includes a list of typically consumed foods and minor changes were made to the questionnaire according to vernacular used by the study population in that particular area.,1
"Participants are asked according to the ~140 food items listed in the QFFQ, the type/brand, cooking methods, frequency and the amount of all food and drink consumed in the past 4 weeks.",1
"For the QFFQ data, portion sizes are converted to grams per week per food item, by two registered dietitians/nutritionists.",1
For the 24-HR all portion sizes are converted to grams per day per food item.,1
The resources to assist with this include the Condensed Food Composition Tables for South Africa [43] and the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC) Food Quantities Manual [44].,1
"Maternal anthropometric measurements\nMaternal weight and mid-upperarm circumference (MUAC) are obtained at each phase (1 to 8), and height only at phase 1 and 5.",1
"All measurements are done twice and recorded to the nearest 0.05\xa0kg for weight, 0.1\xa0cm for MUAC and height.",1
"Standardised methods of the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry [45] are used with a calibrated digital scale for weight, a mobile stadiometer for height; and non-stretchable metal measuring tape for MUAC.",1
Maternal medical assessment and history\nMedical history is obtained at each prenatal visit (phases 1 to 3) by means of participant responses and inspection of medical files.,1
"Information includes medication use (including vaccines), HIV status, obstetric history, hospital admission during pregnancy, use of alcohol, and exposure to passive smoking.",1
At the first postnatal visit (phase 6) a follow-up is made on the maternal medical history at birth.,1
"Blood pressure is measured at each prenatal visit (phases 1 to 3) as well as postnatally (phases 5, 6 and 8) according to international guidelines [46] using calibrated equipment.",1
Appropriate sized cuffs are used for obese participants.,1
Standard procedures are used for a 2-h 75\xa0g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) between 24 and 28\xa0weeks gestation to determine development of gestational diabetes mellitus [47].,1
Maternal morbidity\nMaternal morbidity symptoms are assessed from enrolment to birth using a daily calendar.,1
Mothers are instructed on how to complete the calendar and to return completed calendars at each visit.,1
"The infectious morbidity symptoms assessed are fever, headache, diarrhoea, nasal discharge and coughing.",1
"Other possible pregnancy-related symptoms included are constipation, nausea, vomiting, extreme tiredness and heartburn.",1
Any medication and supplementation use is also recorded daily.,1
"Maternal allergy assessment\nThe International Study for Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire [48] is used to assess allergy symptoms in maternal participants at phases 1 to 3 during pregnancy, and 7 postnatally.",1
"Additionally, skin prick tests for common allergens are used at phase 7 postnatally to assess sensitisation [49].",1
"The questionnaire is designed to assess rhinitis, asthma and eczema in children and has been used successfully in an older black population in South Africa [50].",1
A positive score on any of these three symptoms indicates an allergic phenotype.,1
Maternal skin prick tests are performed by a medical doctor according to the procedure described in the Allergy Society of South Africaâ€™s position statement on skin prick testing [49].,1
"In mothers, sensitisation to a house dust mite mixture including Dermatophagoides farinae, as well as German cockroach, mould mixture, cat and dog dander, maize pollen, Bermuda grass and Quercus robur (English oak), Eucalyptus, Cypressus arizonica (Arizona cypress), Platanus hybrida (London plane) and Acacia trees are measured.",1
"A diagnosis of 1) sensitised with clinical symptoms, 2) sensitised and clinically tolerant, 3) sensitised and unknown clinical reactivity, 4) not sensitised with clinical symptoms, 5) unknown sensitization with clinical symptoms or 6) not sensitized with no clinical symptoms is made.",1
The mother is given medical advice and referred if necessary.,1
"Maternal depression and fatigue\nPerinatal depression is assessed at phases 1 to 3 during pregnancy and at phases 5, 6 and 8 postnatally using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).",1
"The EPDS is a 10-item scale assessing depressive symptoms experienced in the past 7\xa0days [51], which has been validated for assessing perinatal depression in African settings, including South Africa [52].",1
"Maternal fatigue is assessed at the same time points using the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF) scale, which was shown to be a reliable and valid measure of fatigue in pregnant and postpartum women [53].",1
Both questionnaires are interviewer administered.,1
Foetal ultrasonography: Gestational age and foetal growth\nFoetal ultrasonography examination is carried out by an obstetrician at the first data collection time point to confirm gestation.,1
Estimation of foetal crown rump length and/or biparietal diameter or femur length between 6 and 18\xa0weeksâ€™ gestation indicates an accuracy within 5â€“7\xa0days [54].,1
Foetal crown-rump length is used to determine gestational age of participants in their first trimester [55].,1
"For participants in their second trimester, a combination of multiple biometric parameters (biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length) are used to determine gestational age [55].",1
"Ultrasound is also used to determine the number of foetuses and confirm foetal movement, as well as foetal growth at 22 and 36\xa0weeksâ€™ gestation (phases 2 and 3).",1
"Birth and neonatal assessments\nMaternal data collected at birth (phase 4) are obtained from maternal medical files and include hospital admission and discharge dates and times, mode of delivery, induction/augmentation of delivery, type of anaesthetic or pain relief if any, rapid plasma reagin (RPR) status (indicative of syphilis infection), HIV status, rhesus negative status and presence of maternal diabetes mellitus.",1
"If the delivery is induced or caesarean section conducted, the reason for this intervention is obtained.",1
The study nurses obtain maternal weight before birth with a calibrated digital scale.,1
"Neonatal data collected at birth from the medical file include date and time of birth, gender, Apgar score (at 1 and 5\xa0min) [56], vital signs, medical interventions required, foetal distress and presence of meconium stained liquor.",1
"Four identically trained study nurses obtain newborn anthropometry (weight, midarm circumference (MAC), crown-heel length (CHL), head circumference (HC) and thoracic circumference (TC)) within 12\xa0h of birth [57].",1
"If the measurements cannot be taken by the study nurses, hospital records are used to obtain anthropometrical data (using the same calibrated infant scale).",1
Newborn weight is measured with a calibrated digital infant scale to the nearest 10\xa0g. In order to minimize intra-observer variability all circumferences and CHL are measured with an inelastic tape to the nearest 0.5\xa0cm (metal measuring tape not used to prevent possible lacerations).,1
"CHL is measured by placing the newborn in supine position on the tape measure on a flat surface with all limbs extended and measurement taken from vertex to heel of foot, with foot held in a perpendicular position to the leg.",1
Infant dietary intake and feeding practices\nData on infant feeding practices are collected at each postnatal phase (5 to 8).,1
"Mothers are asked how soon after birth the infant was breastfed, if the infant is currently being breastfed and if not, the duration of breastfeeding.",1
"All mothers are asked details about any other food or drink (including infant formula, medicine and supplements) given to the infant.",1
An unquantified food frequency questionnaire for the infant is administered at phases 6 and 8 for qualitative assessment (types and frequency) of milk and complementary feeding at 6 and 12\xa0months postnatally.,1
An adapted questionnaire previously used in the South African context is used [58].,1
"Frequency of the type of food eaten during the past month can be reported by the mother as every day ; most days (not every day, but at least 4 times per week); once a week (less than 4 times per week, but at least once per week) or never .",1
A single 24-HR for the infant is administered at phase 6 for quantitative assessment (macro- and micronutrient intakes) of intakes at 6\xa0months postnatally.,1
Similar methods and aids are used as described for maternal dietary intake.,1
"However, smaller bowls and different sizes of small spoons are used for infant dietary intake to ease realistic reporting for the mother.",1
"Also, emphasis is placed on dished food not eaten and the amount left in the bowl to ensure actual intake is reported.",1
Infant anthropometric measurements\nInfant growth is assessed at each postnatal visit.,1
"Before measurements are taken, the infant is assessed for presence of oedema.",1
"The infant is weighed on a calibrated scale with minimum of clothing, namely only a vest, and without a nappy; and recorded to the nearest 5\xa0g.\nRecumbent length of the infants is taken by means of an infantometer to the nearest 0.1\xa0cm.",1
All foot and headwear is removed before measurements are taken.,1
"The measurement is taken with the infant lying on his/her back on the infantometer, legs extended with the head and foot board making contact with the infant.",1
Infant medical assessments\nA medical doctor performs a general and physical medical assessment of infants at each postnatal visit.,1
"The infant assessment includes HIV status history and a general, ear, nose and throat, respiratory, cardiovascular, abdominal and neurological examination as well as any current complaints.",1
It also includes a medical plan for the infant.,1
Infant morbidity\nInfant morbidity assessment is performed at each postnatal visit by a medical doctor with a structured questionnaire.,1
"A morbidity calendar, kept daily by the mother/caregiver, is used as reference.",1
"The calendar and symptoms are explained to the mother at birth and each postnatal visit up to phase 7, whereby each new section of the calendar is handed to the mother for return at the next visit.",1
"Symptoms assessed are fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, nasal discharge, coughing, diaper and other rash.",1
Any unscheduled visits to a medical facility and medicine given to the infant are also recorded.,1
The medical doctor diagnoses and determines the duration of each morbidity event using the structured questionnaire with reference to the morbidity calendar.,1
Infant allergy assessment\nA medical doctor assesses the allergy phenotype and sensitisation of infants with the Childhood Allergy and Immunology Research (CAIR) questionnaire and skin prick tests at phases 7 and 8 postnatally.,1
"The CAIR questionnaire was developed by the School of Paediatrics and Child Health of the University of Western Australia and is designed to assess asthma, rhinitis and eczema in infants.",1
Infant skin prick tests are performed at phases 7 and 8 by a medical doctor according to the procedure described in the Allergy Society of South Africaâ€™s position statement on skin prick testing [49].,1
"Skin prick tests to determine sensitisation to common allergens are common medical practice in infants older than 4 months [59,60].",1
"In infants, sensitization to a house dust mite mixture including Dermatophagoides farinae, German cockroach, mould mixture, cat and dog dander, maize pollen, Bermuda grass, chicken egg, cowâ€™s milk, cod fish, peanuts, wheat and soy bean flour and potato are measured.",1
"A diagnosis of 1) sensitised with clinical symptoms, 2) sensitised and clinically tolerant, 3) sensitised and unknown clinical reactivity, 4) not sensitised with clinical symptoms, 5) unknown sensitization with clinical symptoms or 6) not sensitized with no clinical symptoms is made.",1
The infantâ€™s medical plan is managed accordingly.,1
"Infant immune response\nThe infantâ€™s IgG response to measles immunisation is assessed at phase 7, which is 6\xa0weeks after measles immunisation was administered at the study site.",1
The measles immunisation in South Africa forms part of the National Expanded Programme for Immunisation and permission to administer it at the study site has been granted by the Department of Health of Gauteng Province and the City of Johannesburg.,1
"Response to an immunisation is regarded as a good marker to measure immune function in vivo [61] and the response will be in the log phase 6\xa0weeks after immunisation, which is the most sensitive stage to measure differences in response among infants.",1
"Infant psychomotor and socio-emotional development\nPsychomotor and socio-emotional development of the offspring is being assessed using the Protocol for Child Monitoring â€“Infant version (PCM-I), which combines both parental report and direct observation by trained assessors to provide a comprehensive evaluation of a childâ€™s motor skills, cognition, language, personal and socio-emotional development [62].",1
"The PCM-I consists of items derived from: 1) the Kilifi Developmental Inventory (KDI) [63], previously used by the investigators to determine psychomotor development in an infant population in South Africa [64], 2) the Developmental Milestone Checklist (DMC-II) [65,66], and 3) the Profile of Social-Emotional Development (PSED), which is based in part on the Brief Infant/Toddler Social Emotional Assessment [67].",1
"Biological sample collection\nVenous blood (42\xa0ml) is drawn from the participating women into labelled EDTA-coated, serum and trace element free evacuated tubes at phases 1â€“4 during pregnancy and at phase 6 postnatally.",1
"At birth (phase 4), umbilical cord blood samples are taken immediately after the separation of the newborn from the umbilical cord and before placental delivery into labelled EDTA-coated, serum and trace element free evacuated tubes.",1
"Venous blood from the infant (3\xa0ml) is drawn at phases 6, 7 and 8.",1
"Dry blood spots are collected on filter paper cards (Whatman, Inc) immediately after blood collection (maternal, cord and infant).",1
"The filter paper cards are allowed to dry at room temperature for 24\xa0h, placed in ziplock bags with desiccants, and stored at âˆ’\u200920\xa0Â°C until analysis.",1
"In case venous blood cannot be obtained from the infants, capillary blood is being collected by foot venepuncture.",1
Venous blood is processed within 1\xa0h after blood draw; plasma/serum separated and red blood cells washed twice with normal saline.,1
Buffy coats are stored in 1:1 vol: vol RNA later (Ambion).,1
"Midstream spot urine samples (5\xa0ml) are collected from the participating women at phases 1, 2 and 3 during pregnancy and at phase 6 postnatally into a urine collection cup.",1
"From the infants, a 2â€“5\xa0ml urine sample is collected at phases 6, 7 and 8 using adhesive paediatric urine collection bags.",1
Urine samples are transferred into labelled microtubes and stored at âˆ’\u200920\xa0Â°C within 4\xa0h.\nBreast milk samples (fore-milk) are collected from lactating mothers at phases 5 and 6 as described previously [68].,1
"Rectal swabs (FLOQSwab, COPAN) are collected from both the mother and the baby at phases 4 and 6 of data collection.",1
"The mucosal microbe sample is taken approximately Â±3\xa0cm into the anal canal, beyond the anal verge.",1
After collection the cotton bud end of the swab with the collected sample is immediately preserved in RNAlater (Ambion) and stored at âˆ’\u200920\xa0Â°C.,1
Biological samples are processed on site and stored at âˆ’\u200920\xa0Â°C for a maximum of 14\xa0days.,1
"Thereafter, frozen samples are transported to the North-West University for storage at âˆ’\u200980\xa0Â°C until analysis.",1
Storage temperature is monitored and logged for the entire duration of the study.,1
"Biochemical analyses\nHaemoglobin is determined on site in whole blood (20\xa0Î¼L) using HemoCue (Hb 201+, Ã„ngelholm, Sweden).",1
"The iron status indices, ferritin and transferrin receptor, as well as the vitamin A status indicator retinol binding protein will be determined using the Q-Plexâ„¢ Human Micronutrient Array (7-plex, Quansys Bioscience, Logan, UT, USA) [69].",1
"This multiplex immune-assay also includes the acute phase proteins C-reactive protein (CRP) and alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), as well as the malaria marker HRP2 and thyroglobulin, which is a marker of iodine status.",1
Urinary iodine concentrations are determined in spot urine samples using a modification of the Sandell-Kolthoff reaction with spectrophotometric detection [70].,1
Vitamin A and E status will be determined using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultraviolet light detection [71].,1
Vitamin D status will be determined by measuring total 25-Hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations in serum using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LCMSMS) [72].,1
Fatty acids in red blood cell total phospholipids are determined using gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GCMSMS) [73].,1
Zinc concentrations are determined in serum using atomic absorption spectrometry [74].,1
"Thyroid hormones (thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroglobulin, total thyroxine) will be determined in whole blood spots by using electrochemiluminescence immunoassays.",1
Lipid-derived immune modulators will be determined with LCMSMS [75].,1
Cytokines and hepcidin will be determined using ELISA.,1
Kynurenine pathway metabolites (mediates interactions between immunological and neurological function) will be determined using LCMSMS [76].,1
Gut microbiome profiling will be done by isolating microbial DNA from the collected rectal swabs using Qiagen Stool minikit and analysing the 16S rRNA genes DNA sequences on the Ion Torrent 16S metagenomics solution offered by ThermoFisher Scientific.,1
"Targeted epigenetic marks, specifically DNA methylation signatures, will also be assessed in the context of the primary and secondary outcomes of this study.",1
Gene specific DNA methylation will be assessed using the Qiagen EpiTech system.,1
"Both, the EpiTect Methyl II Signature and EpiTect Methyl II Complete PCR Arrays (Qiagen) will be considered.",1
"Targeted genotyping of genes of interest in the context of fatty acid, lipid and micronutrient metabolism will also be investigated following the Ion AmpliSeq Targeted Sequencing approach using the Ion Chef â„¢ and Ion S5 â„¢ Systems (ThermoFisher).",1
Data management and analysis\n\nSample size calculation\nThe number of participants to sample has been calculated using the G*Power 3.1.9.2 statistical programme [78].,1
"The statistical calculation involved is the linear multiple regression: fixed model, single regression coefficient.",1
The calculation was based on a small effect size F2of 0.05; probability of error (alpha) of 5%; a power of 80% and ten predictors on the birth outcome â€œlow birth weightâ€.,1
The result was that 196 participants will be required.,1
"Taking into consideration that participants may opt out of the project (at 25% rate), it is calculated that a minimum of 245 participants should be recruited.",1
We intended to recruit a minimum of 250 participants.,1
Data management\nData are managed by two dedicated data managers.,1
Raw data are captured and saved in password protected Microsoft Access documents with passwords known only to the operator responsible for data imputing and the principal investigators.,1
A second person checks 20% of all the captured data randomly and notes and corrects any errors.,1
"If there are more than 5% errors, respective data are re-captured.",1
The final version of the database will be stored under protected zipped files.,1
Data are collected on dual core electronic archives with automatic backup.,1
Information of the single datasets are stored using anonymous IDs.,1
The document linking anonymous IDs to participants will be collected and stored separately.,1
"Dietary data are captured in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Washington, USA) and all electronic entries are double checked by a registered dietitian for the correct food code and a reasonable amount reported.",1
Analyses will be done by the SAMRC by linking data to the most recent food composition database.,1
"Data will then be screened by means of range checks and for outliers in total energy, protein, fat, vitamin A and vitamin C intake.",1
"Data analysis\nOverall, data processing and statistical analysis are performed using the SAS statistical package (SAS, Cary, NC, USA).",1
Analysis of baseline (phase 1) data will be conducted to describe the nutritional status and basic socio-economic characteristics of the pregnant women.,1
Data will be tested for outliers and normality by means of Q-Q plots and histogram visual inspection.,1
Test for normality will be performed by the Shapiro-Wilk test.,1
"Normally distributed data will be expressed as means Â± SD; non-normally distributed data will be expressed as medians (25th percentile, 75th percentile).",1
Data will be analysed cross-sectionally to determine associations between variables at each time point by using appropriate statistical methods (e.g.,1
"multiple linear regression analysis, ANCOVA, logistic regression analysis), adjusting for potential covariates.",1
Data will be analysed prospectively to determine associations between variables at different time points (longitudinally) by using appropriate statistical methods (e.g.,1
"linear mixed effects models), adjusting for potential time-dependent and static covariates.",1
Data will also be analysed retrospectively in matched-control sub-studies by determining associations between observed outcomes and variables collected at previous time points.,1
The level of significance will be set at P \u2009<\u20090.05.,1
"The inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants were designed as such to obtain a sample of generally healthy women, who are able to speak the local language and who could be followed-up from early pregnancy until the infants are 12\xa0months old.",1
