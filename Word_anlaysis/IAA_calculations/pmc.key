PMC key

A BioC format for PubMed Central (PMC) articles.

The goal of this collection is to provide easy access to the text of
PMC articles. All of the text in an article is easily accessible. Some
of the other information in an article is also available.

The goal is NOT to replace the XML format in which PMC articles are
currently available. To access all of the detailed information in an
article, PMC XML is the format of choice. If one wants to access the text
of an article, then BioC is a more convenient choice.

Because of their widely differing origins, PMC XML files have the
information stored in different arrangements. This is true, even
though all the XML files follow the same DTD. The BioC collection does
not normalize all of these differences.

encoding:    Unicode
             These are the original characters from the PMC
             documents. These include Unicode characters with more
             than 16 bits or beyond the Basic Multilingal Plane.

collection:  The Open Access subset of PMC articles. 

source:      PMC

date:        yyyymmdd. Date articles downloaded from PMC.

document:    PMC article

id:          PMC id

passage:     One portion of a PMC article. Often a paragraph or
             subsection title. Details provided by type.

infon type:  String indicating the type of passage from the PMC
             article. Details provided below.

offset:      PMC is extracted from an XML file, so literal offsets
             would not be useful. The first passage (title) has an
             offset of zero. Each following passage has an offset
             increased by the number of bytes in the text of a passage
             plus one space. These offsets at least sequence the
             passages.

text:        The ASCII text of the passage.             


infon key="type" for passages:

front

  text is the title of the document. 
  The infon pairs are described with the ref section.  

abstract

  Abstract for the article.

abstract_title_1

  Title for a section of the abstract in a structured abstract.

title

  Section title for a section not part of the main text.

title_1

  Section title

title_2

  Subsection title, and so on. For example, title_3 would be a
  subsubsection title. title_4 has been seen.

fig_caption

  Caption for a figure.

fig_title_caption

  The title of a figure caption, if it is explicitly indicated in the
  XML. If the figure caption title is merely indicated by bold text,
  then it appears as part of the caption.

footnote

  Text in a footnote in the article.

footnote_title

  Title of a footnote.

paragraph

  Ordinary paragraph of text in the article.  To understand where in
  the article it belongs, the previous title passages would need to be
  tracked. 

table_caption

  Caption for a table.

table

  contents of a table. The elements of a table concatenated together
  with space between them. These spaces may allow proper
  tokenization. Unlikely to be useful. For now, the PMC XML should be
  processed directly to obtain the structure of the table.

table_footnote

  Footnote to a table

table_title_caption

  Title for the table caption.

ref

  A source referenced by the article. The text will be the title of
  the source, if indicated in the XML.

  In addtion, there will be a number of infon key:value pairs.  The
  keys maybe strings like "fpage", "volume", or "year". The exact list
  of keys depends on the format of the reference in the PMC XML
  file.

  If the source authors are indicated in the XML, they will have keys
  of "name_0", "name_1", etc. Each value is another key:value list,
  separated by semi-colons (;). Keys in this sublist are "surname",
  "given-names", etc.
