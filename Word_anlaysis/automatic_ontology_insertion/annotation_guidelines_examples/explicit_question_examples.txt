EXPLICIT QUESTION = an explicit statement of inquiry (with a question mark or question word such as how, where, what, why). The next actionable step is to find answers to the questions and/or discover methodologies that will help answer the question.

a.	ASKED/WONDERED
1)	“to further understand the molecular mechanism in lyn-mediated autophagosome formation, <we ASKED which domain(s) of lyn is required for interaction with the functionally or structurally relevant proteins>.” [a specific research question: which domain(s) of lyn…?]
2)	“of five items that examined attitudes and beliefs about treatment decisions, two statements specifically ASKED patients about their need to have control over decisions about treatment.” [a description of methodology where patients were asked, no explicit research question]
3)	“since pre- xrn-2 mrna levels increase in bpnt-1(xe22) in the apparent absence of increased rpl-43promoperon promoter activity, <we WONDERED if rpl-43icr might exhibit promoter activity>.” [a specific research question: does rpl-43 exhibit promoter activity?]
4)	“−in post experimental interviews many subjects stated that they “never WONDERED about it,” “never thought of that before,” etc.” [wondering is a part of a quote from subjects, no explicit research question]
b.	QUESTIONS/ RESEARCH QUESTION(S)
1)	“<this QUESTION has received extensive empirical investigation since the early 1900s>[4], in part because the answers may elucidate a host of important issues in cognitive and social psychology, such as the role of experience in the formation of visual processing expertise and the origin and establishment of racial prejudice and stereotypes[1]–[3],[5],[6].” [an explicit question has received a lot of attention]
2)	“thus, the modified bdq detected functional symptoms in non-patient subjects with a greater frequency than the “healthy” QUESTION or the rome criteria.” [a comparison statement of methodologies that the “healthy question” did not do as well, no explicit research question]
3)	“this study raises intriguing <QUESTIONS regarding the roles of glnd and glnk in mycobacteria>.” [specific research questions regarding the roles of glnd and glnk in mycobacteria]
4)	“patients respond to the QUESTIONS on a five-point likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very), with two open-ended items requesting patients to identify ‘most helpful’ and ‘least helpful’ parts of the web program.” [a description of the methodology where patients respond to questions, no explicit research question]
5)	“our <RESEARCH QUESTIONS were: (1) what is the incidence, consequences, nature, and preventability of surgical aes among hospitalized patients, and (2) what are the causes of, and potential prevention strategies for, surgical aes?>” [an explicit statement of research questions]
6)	“these were assigned as follows: yes* (3 points) to abstracts that definitely informed the RESEARCH QUESTIONS and that met the search criteria outlined above, yes (2 points) to abstracts that were likely to inform the research questions, possible (1 point) to abstracts that might possibly inform the research questions, or no (0 points) to abstracts that did not inform the review questions.” [a description of the methodology about how to assign abstracts as being relevant to the research questions or not, no explicit questions]
c.	CAN/DOES/IS/WHICH + ? (with a question mark ideally)
1)	“<DOES the b. oleracea origin of the resyn lines, which were used as hybrid parents, influence hybrid yield?>” [explicit research question: does the origin influence hybrid yield?]
2)	“in the current study we addressed the following research questions: (a) <ARE the intelligence factor structures (i.e., single-factor structure and two-factor structure) of the rias invariant across individuals with and without a migration background>, and (b) do individuals with and without a migration background differ in latent means and variances in the rias intelligence factors (the vix, nix, and cix)?” [a statement of explicit research questions: (a) are… (b) do…]
3)	“the specific research questions were: (1) <CAN participants be classified into groups based on their scores on the individual wellness dimensions?>” [a statement of explicit research questions: can…?]
4)	“in our work we addressed protein sampling by hla class i molecules to answer two questions: 1) <WHICH proteins are sampled by the antigen processing pathway> and why, and 2) which peptides of a given protein are picked to represent the source protein on the cell surface?” [a statement of explicit research questions: 1) which proteins… 2) which peptides… - no specifics/options about the proteins or peptides]
5)	“index of belief in curabilityi believe that my cancer: 1. IS curable 2. is not curable 3. don't know regardless of what your doctors have told you, how long do you expect to survive?” [a questionnaire question about curability of cancer, no explicit research question]
d.	WHAT
1)	“there is no report showing how bk improves skin disorders and <WHAT constituents contribute to bk's effect>.” [explicit research question: what constituents contribute to bk’s effect?]
2)	“nonetheless, it is helpful to examine how the simulated values of diversity compare to empirical observations, and <WHAT these comparisons might tell us about the evolutionary processes that are acting on microbiomes>.” [explicit research question: what these comparisons tell us about…]
3)	“it is worth pausing at this point to clarify WHAT we mean when we say that hosts acquire their microbiomes from their “parents” or their “environments”.” [a clarification of a definition, no explicit research question]
e.	WHERE
1)	“mapping such deposits will aid our knowledge of when, how frequently and <from WHERE such events occur>.” [an explicit research question: where such events occur?]
2)	“the anova was calculated as a mixed model, WHERE the effect of the location was considered random and the effect of the genotype was considered fixed.” [a clarification about the anova, no explicit research question]
f.	WHEN
1)	“mapping such deposits will aid our knowledge of <WHEN, how frequently and from where such events occur>.” [an explicit research question: when such events occur?]
2)	“WHEN irradiated with lower-energy uv–a light, the presence of oxygen from the ambient atmosphere played a significant role, where the use of a quartz mask limiting the supply of oxygen notably slowed down the ageing of the polymer.” [a description of what happens in the ambient atmosphere, no explicit research question]
g.	WHY
1)	“this may be a contributing factor to <WHY obese patients that develop pca have more aggressive disease and a higher mortality rate> (22–24).” [an explicit research question: why obese patients…]
2)	“it is not clear <WHY the ectopic expression of histone h1 even by the strong promoters failed to restore the chromatin-bound histone h1 protein level in rasg12v-transfected cells>.” [an explicit research question: why the ectopic expression…]
3)	“structure of each session in the refresh (recovery from cancer-related fatigue) programobjectives and outlinethe objectives and outline provides a rationale for learning the material from that session by reminding participants about what has been covered to date and addressing the questions, ‘what will i learn in this session?’ and ‘WHY is this session important?’main contenteach session typically requires 30–45 min to complete.” [a quoted question that participants were asked, no explicit research question]
h.	HOW
1)	“the purpose of this study is to examine <HOW likely it is that a patient will be harmed compared to benefit> assuming all patients expose themselves to an initial increased risk with transplantation.” [an explicit research question: how likely is it…]
2)	“figure 2shows visually HOW the percentages for ‘no benefit', ‘harm’ and ‘benefit’ were derived.” [a description of methodology about how percentages were derived, no explicit research question]
