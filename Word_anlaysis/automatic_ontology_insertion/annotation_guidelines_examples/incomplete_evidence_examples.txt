INCOMPLETE EVIDENCE = a positive or negative statement proposing a possible/feasible explanation for a phenomenon on the basis of limited evidence as a starting point for further investigation OR a statement that information is needed to support an assertion or claim, including both positive and negative statements. Either a statement that some evidence already exists, explaining how current findings support previous work, adding confidence to a claim OR a statement that information is limited, more research is needed or is ongoing including limitations – biases or short comings related to the study design and execution. The next actionable step is to gather more evidence to support the claim OR conduct more research to determine the validity of the claim; Complete the partial picture; Consider the short comings and biases for the next experiment and how it can be addressed.
Due to this being the largest category, we split up the linguistic cues into 4 categories based on the stage of the research: early, middle, late, reflection. You do not need to classify these when you are annotating. This is only to provide a little more categorization when going through examples. The template is: “need more evidence for <subject>”.
