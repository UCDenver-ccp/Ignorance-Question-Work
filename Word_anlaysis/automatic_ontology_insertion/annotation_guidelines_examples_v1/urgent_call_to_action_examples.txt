q.	URGENT/ URGENTLY
1)	“due to its widespread application in communications, radar, etc., <the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ofdm) signal has become increasingly URGENT in the field of localization>.” [urgent call to use the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signal in the field of localization]
2)	“therefore, <it is URGENT to explore more ssr markers to construct high-density linkage maps and identify many more qtl for marker-assisted selection in foxtail millet>.” [urgent call to explore more ssr markers to construct high-density linkage maps and identify many more qtl for marker-associated selection in foxtail millet]
3)	“however, the results of two randomized trials (stability[15] and the solid-timi 52 [16], which were conducted to test whether darapladib reduces cardiovascular events in stable and unstable coronary heart disease) did not demonstrate any beneficial effect on any of the primary endpoints (cardiovascular death, stroke, myocardial infarction, or URGENT coronary artery revascularization).” [a results statement with no beneficial effects on any of the primary endpoints including ‘urgent coronary artery revascularization’, not a statement that lays out a specific call to action that needs immediate attention]
4)	“william rushton, lds, asked if the matter was URGENT.” [a statement of what William Rushton asked: if the matter was urgent?, not a statement that lays out a specific call to action that needs immediate attention]
5)	“<an efficacious hiv vaccine is URGENTLY needed to curb the aids pandemic>.” [urgent call for an efficacious hiv vaccine to curb the aids pandemic]
6)	“however, <the functioning of active management for the benefit of threatened carabid species URGENTLY demands critical evaluation and detailed information>.” [urgent call for critical evaluation and detailed information on the functioning of active management for the benefit of threatened carabid species]
7)	“between april 2010 and april 2013, 52 patients with stanford type a acute aortic dissection (mean age 69.6; 20 men and 32 women) were treated surgically, either URGENTLY or emergently, with hemiarch or arch replacement under deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.” [a results statement that 52 patients had either an urgent or emergent surgery, not a statement that lays out a specific call to action that needs immediate attention]
8)	“three weeks later, he was admitted URGENTLY to our hospital due to generalised abdominal pain and watery diarrhoea.” [a patient statement who needed to be urgently admitted to the hospital, not a statement that lays out a specific call to action that needs immediate attention]

r.	VITAL
1)	“telomere-linked control of phenotypic variation is an important issue in malaria pathogenesis and <a better knowledge of the epigenetic factors controlling those is VITAL for understanding the disease and to develop new anti-parasite control strategies>.” [urgent call for better knowledge of the epigenetic factors controlling those (telomere-linked control of phenotypic variation) for understanding the disease and to develop new anti-parasite control strategies]
2)	“as described above, since surround suppression may involve contributions from horizontal and feedback inputs, <it is VITAL to know the interplay of excitation and inhibition in different domains of pc dendrites, which may shed light upon active dendritic processes involved in this phenomenon> (london and häusser,2005).” [urgent call to know the interplay of excitation and inhibition in different domains of pc dendrites, which may she light upon active dendritic processes involved in this phenomenon]
3)	“vr, VITAL registration.” [an acronym that stands for ‘vital registration’, not a statement that lays out a specific call to action that needs immediate attention]
4)	“dna methylation is also shown to be VITAL in the maintenance of x chromosome inactivation which is crucial for female embryos due to the presence of two x chromosomes [11].” [a mechanistic statement that dna methylation is crucial in the maintenance of x chromosome inactivation, not a statement that lays out a specific call to action that needs immediate attention]
